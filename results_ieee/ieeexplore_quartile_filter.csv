Unfortunately, effective slicing of Radio Access Networks (RAN) is still challenging due to time-varying network situations. This paper proposes a new intelligent RAN slicing strategy with two-layered control granularity, which aims at maximizing both the long-term QoS of services and spectrum efficiency (SE) of slices. The proposed method consists of an upper-level controller to ensure the QoS performance, which enforces loose control by performing adaptive slice configuration according to the long-term dynamics of service traffic. The lower-level controller is to improve SE of slices, by tightly scheduling radio resources to users at the small time-scale. To realize the proposed RAN slicing strategy, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is a hierarchical structure that collaboratively integrating the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and double deep-Q-network algorithm. Specifically, the lower-level control problem is a mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem with multiple constraints. This kind of problem is hard to be directly solved by the exiting DRL algorithms, since it involves searching for the solution in a vast set of mixed-integer action space, which will induce unbearable computational complexity. Thus, we propose a novel action space reducing approach, embedding the convex optimization tools into the DDPG algorithm, to speed up the lower-level control. Furthermore, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent RAN slicing scheme.",15580857,,10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3090423,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Program(grant numbers:RGPIN2018-06254); Canada Research Chair Program; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9459763,Network slicing;5G beyond;6G;deep reinforcement learning;and radio resource management,Quality of service;Network slicing;Stochastic processes;Resource management;Optimization;Mathematical model;Dynamic scheduling,,84.0,,34.0,IEEE,18 Jun 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
Customized Slicing for 6G: Enforcing Artificial Intelligence on Resource Management,W. Guan; H. Zhang; V. C. M. Leung,"University of Science and Technology, Beijing, China; University of Science and Technology, Beijing, China; Shenzhen University, China",IEEE Network,8 Nov 2021,2021,35.0,5.0,264,271,"Next generation wireless networks are expected to support diverse vertical industries and offer countless emerging use cases. To satisfy stringent requirements of diversified services, network slicing is developed, which enables service-oriented resource allocation by tailoring the infrastructure network into multiple logical networks. However, there are still some challenges in cross-domain multi-dimensional resource management for end-to-end (E2E) slices under the dynamic and uncertain environment. Trading off the revenue and cost of resource allocation while guaranteeing service quality is significant to tenants. Therefore, this article introduces a hierarchical resource management framework, utilizing deep reinforcement learning in admission control of resource requests from different tenants and resource adjustment within admitted slices for each tenant. In particular, we first discuss the challenges in customized resource management of 6G. Second, the motivation and background are presented to explain why artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in resource customization of multi-tenant slicing. Third, E2E resource management is decomposed into two problems, multi-dimensional resource allocation decision based on slice-level feedback, and real-time slice adaption aimed at avoiding service quality degradation.

The article then introduces a novel statistical federated learning (StFL)-based analytic engine for zero-touch 6G massive network slicing, which performs slice-level resource prediction by learning in an offline fashion while respecting some preset long-term service level agreement (SLA) constraints defined in terms of the empirical cumulative distribution function and the percentile statistics, and hence uses a new proxy-Lagrangian two-player strategy to solve the local non-convex federated learning task without settling for surro-gates only. This guarantees 20 × lower service-lev-el agreement (SLA) violation rate with respect to the federated averaging (FedAvg) scheme, while achieving more than 10 × EE gain compared to an SLA-constrained centralized deep learning algorithm, which paves the way to sustainable mas-sive network slicing.

In this context, energy efficiency becomes a critical challenge to be solved for harnessing these promising applications to realize “green” 6G networks. As a remedy, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been proposed for improving energy efficiency by beneficially reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. In conventional RIS solutions, however, the received signal-to-in-terference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) sometimes may become degraded. This is because the signals impinging on an RIS are typically contaminated by interfering signals that are usually dynamic and unknown. To address this issue, “learning” the properties of the surrounding spectral environment is a promising solution, motivating the convergence of artificial intelligence and spectrum sensing, referred to here as spectrum learning (SL). Inspired by this, we develop an SL-aided RIS framework for intelligently exploiting the inherent characteristics of the radio frequency spectrum for green 6G networks. Given the proposed framework, the RIS controller becomes capable of intelligently “thinking and deciding” whether or not to reflect the incident signals. Therefore, the received SINR can be improved by dynamically configuring the binary ON-OFF status of the RIS elements. The energy efficiency benefits attained are validated with the aid of a specific case study.

In the context of 6G, more computing resources are required, a problem that is dealt with by Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). However, due to the dynamic change of service demands from various locations, the limitation of available computing resources of MEC, and the increase in the number and complexity of IoE services, intelligent resource provisioning for multiple applications is vital. To address this challenging issue, we propose in this paper IScaler, a novel intelligent and proactive IoE resource scaling and service placement solution. IScaler is tailored for MEC and benefits from the new advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Multiple requirements are considered in the design of IScaler's Markov Decision Process. These requirements include the prediction of the resource usage of scaled applications, the prediction of available resources by hosting servers, performing combined horizontal and vertical scaling, as well as making service placement decisions. The use of DRL to solve this problem raises several challenges that prevent the realization of IScaler's full potential, including exploration errors and long learning time. These challenges are tackled by proposing an architecture that embeds an Intelligent Scaling and Placement module (ISP). ISP utilizes IScaler and an optimizer based on heuristics as a bootstrapper and backup.

That means, unless new degrees of freedom and intelligent dynamic adaptability is added, any significant gain in SE must come at the cost of EE. Even the most predominant approaches for capacity enhancement such as network densification yield gains in SE at the cost of increased energy consumption. Moreover, in future mobile networks, the key challenge is not only the rampantly growing volume of traffic, but also the spatiotemporal variability of the traffic. These observations call for a paradigm shift in the way cellular networks are designed and operated. Therefore, in this work, we propose a new cellular architecture called SpiderNet: Spectrally Efficient and Energy Efficient Data Aided Demand Driven Elastic Architecture for 6G Wireless Networks. The key idea behind SpiderNet is to introduce additional degrees of freedom to relax the tight coupling between the SE and EE and database-aided intelligence to enable dynamic adaptive operation for simultaneous enhancement of both SE and EE. This goal is achieved by shifting the pivot of operation from the rigid always ON BS centric cells to user centric (UC) on demand cells. The SpiderNet architecture consists of a layer of low-density large footprint and database aided control BS underlayed by high-density switchable data BS. This database enables artificial intelligence (AI) powered proactive dynamic orchestration of UC cells to maximize not only SE and EE, but quality of experience (QoE) as well. We also identify the challenges that arise in the practical realization of SpiderNet and propose solutions. Finally, we present a case study that compares SpiderNet performance with legacy HetNets.

Moreover, with the rise of massive internet-of-things, and automation, technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have emerged as prominent players to drive a range of applications. Currently, sixth-generation (6G) networks support enhanced holographic projection through terahertz (THz) bandwidths, ultra-low latency, and massive device connectivity. However, the data is exchanged between autonomous networks over untrusted channels. Thus, to ensure data security, privacy, and trust among stakeholders, blockchain (BC) opens new dimensions towards intelligent resource management, user access control, audibility, and chronology in stored transactions. Thus, the BC and 6G coalition in future AR/VR applications is an emerging investigative topic. To date, authors have proposed surveys that study the integration of BC and 6G in AR/VR in isolation, and hence a coherent survey is required. Thus, to address the gap, the survey is the first-of-its-kind to investigate and study the coalition of BC and 6G in AR/VR space. Based on the proposed research questions in the survey, a solution taxonomy is presented, and different verticals are studied in detail. Furthermore, an integrative architecture is proposed, and open issues and challenges are presented. Finally, a case study, BvTours, is presented that presents a unique survey on BC-based 6G-assisted AR/VR virtual home tour service.

Accelerating Reinforcement Learning via Predictive Policy Transfer in 6G RAN Slicing,A. M. Nagib; H. Abou-Zeid; H. S. Hassanein,"School of Computing, Queen’s University, ON, Kingston, Canada; Department of Electrical and Software Engineering, University of Calgary, AB, Calgary, Canada; School of Computing, Queen’s University, ON, Kingston, Canada",IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,29 Jun 2023,2023,20.0,2.0,1170,1183,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have recently been proposed to solve dynamic radio resource management (RRM) problems in beyond 5G networks. However, RL-based solutions are still not widely adopted in commercial cellular networks. One of the primary reasons for this is the slow convergence of RL agents when they are deployed in a live network and when the network’s context changes significantly. Concurrently, the open radio access network (O-RAN) paradigm promises to give mobile network operators (MNOs) more control over their networks, furthering the need for intelligent and RL-based network management. O-RAN’s standardized interfaces will allow MNOs to make real-time custom changes to intelligently control various RRM functionalities. We consider a RAN slicing scenario in which MNOs can modify the weights of the RL reward function. This enables MNOs to change the priorities of fulfilling the service level agreements of the slices. However, this results in a practical challenge since the RL agent needs to adapt promptly to the changes made by the MNO. This challenge is addressed in this paper, where we first present and discuss the results from an exhaustive experiment to examine the efficiency of using transfer learning (TL) to accelerate the convergence of RL-based RAN slicing in the considered scenario. We then propose a novel predictive approach to enhance the TL-based acceleration by selecting the best-saved policy for reuse. By adopting the proposed policy transfer approach, RL agents are able to converge up to 14000 learning steps faster than their non-accelerated counterparts. The proposed machine learning (ML)-based predictive approach also shows up to a 96.5% accuracy in selecting the best expert policy to reuse for acceleration.",19324537,,10.1109/TNSM.2023.3258692,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:RGPIN-2019-05667,RGPIN-2021-04050); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10075524,O-RAN;RAN slicing;resource allocation;predictive transfer learning;accelerated reinforcement learning;6G,Resource management;Next generation networking;Convergence;Radio access networks;Wireless networks;Accelerated aging;Knowledge engineering,,8.0,,37.0,IEEE,17 Mar 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Moreover, most existing approaches require the instantaneous channel gain between subnetworks, which are usually difficult to be collected. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose a novel effective intelligent radio resource management method using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL), which only needs the sum of received power, named received signal strength indicator (RSSI), on each channel instead of channel gains. However, to directly separate individual interference from RSSI is an almost impossible thing. To this end, we further propose a novel MARL architecture, named GA-Net, which integrates a hard attention layer to model the importance distribution of inter-subnetwork relationships based on RSSI and excludes the impact of unrelated subnetworks, and employs a graph attention network with a multi-head attention layer to exact the features and calculate their weights that will impact individual throughput.

However, one of the biggest difference between the sixth generation (6G) and its predecessor is the ability to support high speed connectivity of mobile services for global coverage, especially focusing on under-connected areas (e.g., forests, oceans, deserts, and mountains). Integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) provide the best solution to unravel the unconnected issues of isolated areas not only on the ground but also in the air and on the sea. Despite this premise, the research in ISTNs is still in its infancy with many open problems, associated with long delay communications, large coverage for massive number of devices, and highly demanding real-time services. To alleviate these problems, this article introduces optimal multi-beam design empowered by machine learning techniques for 6G ISTNs, with respect to the real-time constraints of mission-critical services. First, we give an overview of the multibeam design for 6G ISTNs with user clustering approaches, energy-efficiency radio resource allocation, and distributed computing. Then, the frameworks for intelligent multibeam based on machine learning, real-time optimisation, and game theory, are proposed. As case studies, we investigate the performance of machine learning-aided real-time optimisation for 6G ISTNs in disaster relief and real-time optimal multibeam in satellite-terrestrial IoT networks.

Among O-RAN, the newly introduced radio intelligence controller (RIC), including near-real-time RIC and non-real-time RIC, provides intelligent control of the radio network. However, existing research on RIC only focuses on the implementation of interfaces and progress, while ignoring the resource allocation between near-RT RIC and non-RT RIC which is essential for ultra-low latency in 6G networks. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based resource allocation scheme that minimizes service latency by optimizing requests allocated and processed between near-RT RIC and non-RT RIC. Specifically, we aim at improving the request acceptance and minimum the average service latency, in our policy, we apply the Double DQN to decide whether the requests are processed at near-RT RIC or non-RT RIC and then allocate the near-RT RIC resource to finish the requests. Firstly, we define and formulate the resource allocation problem in RIC by the Markov decision process framework. Then we propose an allocation scheme based on the Double Deep Q network technique (Double DQN), with two variations (Double DQN with cache and Double DQN without cache) for handling different request types.

Since satellite networks are time-varying and have limited resources, efficient resource management schemes are needed to accommodate massive and ubiquitous service requests. As a remedy, virtual network embedding (VNE) can enable diverse virtual network requests (VNRs) to share the same substrate network resources to improve resource utilization. However, existing works are few and mainly rely on heuristic methods, whose static embedding strategies cannot be optimized according to the resource state.

Besides, we design a novel preprocessing scheme to reduce mapping failure, where the satellite network is divided into multiple mapping regions, and VNRs are only deployed in the mapping region with the lowest load. In the node mapping stage, the DRL agent can calculate the embedding probabilities of each physical node based on the environment state.

An asynchronous weight updating method is adopted to avoid redundant learning transfer in the federated learning.

At mmWaves/sub-THz frequencies, MIMO channels exhibit few leading paths in the space-time (ST) domain (i.e., directions or arrival/departure and delays). Algebraic low-rank (LR) channel estimation exploits ST channel sparsity through the computation of position-dependent MIMO channel eigenmodes leveraging recurrent training vehicle passages in the coverage cell. LR requires vehicles’ geographical positions and tens to hundreds of training vehicles’ passages for each position, leading to significant complexity and control signaling overhead. Here, we design a deep-learning (DL)-based LR channel estimation method to infer MIMO channel eigenmodes in V2X urban settings, starting from a single least squares (LS) channel estimate and without needing vehicle’s position information. Numerical results show that the proposed method attains comparable mean squared error (mse) performance as the position-based LR. Moreover, we show that the proposed model can be trained on a reference scenario and be effectively transferred to urban contexts with different ST channel features, providing comparable mse performance without an explicit transfer learning procedure.

However, satisfying the demands of network slice requests is a challenging task. Energy-efficient, secure, and Quality of Service (QoS) aware network slicing is important since network slices must share fewer amounts of resources. Further, implementing secure network slicing for software-defined networks (SDNs)/network function virtualization (NFV) is crucial. In this article, we tackle the issues, such as security, QoS, and resource consumption issues through network slicing and load balancing mechanisms in SDN/NFV assisted 6G environments. First, deep network slicing is implemented using generative adversarial network (GAN) for network slicing and management. Based on the slice capacity, slice priority, and QoS demands of network slices, GAN predicts the appropriate slice and links for data transmission. For each slice, the directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based blockchain technology is used in which traditional consensus is replaced by the Proof of Space (PoS) algorithm. A limitation of scalability and high resource consumption in the traditional blockchain is addressed in DAG-blockchain. To improve security, context-based authentication, and secure handover schemes are presented using the Markov decision making (MDM) and weighted product model, respectively. Then, higher load faced at the SDN controllers and switches are addressed by intruder packets classification and packets migration through hybrid neural decision tree (HyDNT) and Hybrid Political optimizer with a Heap-based Optimizer (HPoHO), respectively.

The scheme exploits the advantages of deep-Q-network (DQN) and minimizes the search state explosion through a reward-penalty framework. A dynamic allocation of unallocated resource blocks (RBs) to mobile units (MUs) is carried out and once the allocation of RBs is complete, we integrate blockchain (BC) to record the transactional ledgers. The resource usage of MUs is recorded through smart contracts (SCs). We model the proposed scheme as a convex optimization problem, and subproblems are decomposed into a Pareto-optimal solution via Techebyecheff decomposition. In the simulation, we compare our scheme against FSA, and fifth-generation (5G) based DSA schemes like reinforcement learning (RL), deep neural networks (DNN)-based, and duelling DQN based schemes. The comparative analysis of 6G-DQN is modeled in terms of reward formulation, scalability of 6G-DQN-assisted DSA, and profit scenarios of BC-based allocation through intelligent channel control. The scheme proposes significant findings, with the best fit learning rate of 0.0001, and takes 500 episodes to converge to 60 total resource blocks. The servicing latency of the scheme is 272.4 ms, compared to 2010 ms in the duelling DQN approach. In spectrum allocation, an improvement of 26.32% is observed against non-DQN approaches, and 13.57% in the fairness parameter for spectrum allocation due to BC inclusion.

Traditionally, most service provisioning techniques considered security metrics separately from the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Expectation (QoE) parameters. The QoS/QoE parameters include data throughput, experienced delay, tolerable latency, jitter, resource utilization rate, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, fairness, and other emerging key performance indicators (KPIs). Also, there are various security attributes, such as encryption key strength, authentication strength, network anomaly score, privacy metric, and so on. Typically, the resource allocation optimization techniques to maximize the security aspects to protect the communication of mobile users or user equipment (UEs) have an adverse effect on the service quality. Therefore, a key research gap exists in balancing service quality and security levels in communication networks that has been either overlooked or identified in a rather scattered manner by researchers in the recent decade. Thus, a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art to clearly address this research gap and outline the possible solutions is yet to appear in the existing literature. In this paper, we address this by surveying the existing practices, challenges, and opportunities in the emerging 6G (i.e., beyond 5G) networks, where various AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based techniques such as deep learning meet the classical optimization techniques, to balance the service performance and security levels. Several networking topologies with relevant use-cases are included in the survey to discuss the existing and emerging trends of isolated as well as joint treatment of service and security levels.

The rising and inevitable off-loading requirements of IoE devices have resulted in an unprecedented increase in the reliance on edge and cloud paradigms. However, such a reliance on far-end technologies to access already scarce resources can often result in increased latency and unstable connection issues due to limited bandwidth. In this paper, we investigate the solution for such a stringent network design by presenting a conceptual cloud architecture based on key components such as resource allocation, scheduling and task off-loading for IoE devices. The IoE devices utilise a scheduler to access resources from nearby higher resourced IoE devices for their task computation, where the scheduler allocates incoming requests according to the availability of resources within a cluster of devices or to other devices in nearby clusters. Motivated by these design characteristics, we propose a design of a novel Main Task Off-loading Scheduling Algorithm (MTOSA) for efficient task allocation and dissemination. We present a theoretical analysis of five different scheduling policies namely Round Robin (RR), Strongest Channel (SC), Max Rate (MR), Proportional Fair (PF) and Priority Base (PB) scheduling to find an optimal technique for task off-loading in futuristic networks. Furthermore, we compare the performance of these five scheduling policies with the two existing scheduling policies from the literature.

A series of white papers and survey papers have been published, which aim to define 6G in terms of requirements, application scenarios, key technologies, etc. Although ITU-R has been working on the 6G vision and it is expected to reach a consensus on what 6G will be by mid-2023, the related global discussions are still wide open and the existing literature has identified numerous open issues. This paper first provides a comprehensive portrayal of the 6G vision, technical requirements, and application scenarios, covering the current common understanding of 6G. Then, a critical appraisal of the 6G network architecture and key technologies is presented. Furthermore, existing testbeds and advanced 6G verification platforms are detailed for the first time. In addition, future research directions and open challenges are identified to stimulate the on-going global debate.

However, the system performance of ABS-assisted networks is severely confined by the limited endurance of the on-board battery. To overcome this energy issue, we are exploring the robotic airborne base station (RABS) with energy neutral grasping end-effectors able to autonomously perch at tall urban landforms. This paper studies the optimal deployment (fly to another grasping location or remain in the same one) and operation (active or sleep mode at an epoch) of RABS based on the spatio-temporal distribution of underlying traffic load, which problem is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) aiming to maximize the volume of served traffic load under the on-board energy constraints. To tackle the curse of dimensionality in this ILP formulation, we first investigate a special case with a single RABS in the system and develop a Lagrangian heuristic algorithm to solve it by exploiting the totally unimodularity structure. A polynomial-time method is then proposed to decompose the multi-RABS problem into several single-RABS cases based on the Hungarian algorithm. In terms of aggregated traffic that can be supported, numerical results reveal that a single RABS outperforms four (4) fixed micro cells when the serving duration ranges from 10 to 24 hours, allowing in that sense efficient network densification. The traffic loaded in a RABS is 3.2 times higher than a fixed small cell when the traffic distribution is highly heterogeneous.

Research has gained momentum over the past few years to study the gains of RIS and the optimal configuration of its elements. This paper is concerned with the optimal configuration of RIS elements; we consider a single base station (BS) serving multiple single-antenna users and formulate the problem of minimizing the total transmit power while jointly optimizing the allocated power to users and the RIS phase shifts. In line with the existing literature, the problem is decomposed into power control and RIS phase shift sub-problems. The power control sub-problem is the conventional power problem which is solved optimally through closed-form expression. Then, we tackle the problem of RIS passive beamforming optimization and propose two solutions leveraging a linear transformation and element-wise Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT), respectively. The main idea of the linear transformation approach is to reduce the number of optimization variables to the number of users associated with the RIS from the number of its elements which is, in general, very large. On the other hand, the main idea of the element-wise KKT-based approach is to obtain a closed-form expression for the RIS phase shifts for a multi-user scenario, similar to the single-user case. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes have performance in total transmitted power close to the numerical solution and have much lower computational complexity than the baseline solutions. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed solutions have a competitive performance in terms of optimality and complexity for large-scale RIS. Hence, our approach represents a general framework for configuring RIS elements in real scenarios.",19399359,,10.1109/TVT.2022.3233469,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Fonds Québécois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies; Concordia University; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040911,6G;linear transformation;RIS;SDR,Optimization;Complexity theory;Array signal processing;6G mobile communication;Wireless networks;Closed-form solutions;Resource management,,13.0,,39.0,IEEE,8 Feb 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Regardless of the distributions of data and services, High-Performance Computing (HPC) enhances speed and provides diversified applications and functionality. The Confluence-Aided Process Organization Method (CAPOM) is suggested in this article to take advantage of process allocations while using an HPC paradigm. The process allocations and completions are scheduled based on prior and current system conditions to minimize waiting time based on the 6G qualities. This implies that state requirements for process allocation, distribution, and completion are carried out with the assistance of federated learning. The initial state allocations are based on the user/application request; in other allocations, the application’s request for completion time and capacity for processing are considered. Offloading and shared processing are, therefore combined to maximize resource deliveries. The federated learning states are checked post-completion times to mitigate the waiting duration of dense service demands. Indicators such as distribution ratios, latency, wait time, and processing rate are considered for the effectiveness of the proofs.

In this paper, we introduce an interdisciplinary approach linking the concepts of e-healthcare, priority, big data analytics (BDA) and radio resource optimization in a multi-tier 5G network. We employ three machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, naïve Bayesian (NB) classifier, logistic regression (LR), and decision tree (DT), working as an ensemble system to analyze historical medical records of stroke out-patients (OPs) and readings from body-attached internet-of-things (IoT) sensors to predict the likelihood of an imminent stroke. We convert the stroke likelihood into a risk factor functioning as a priority in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Hence, the task is to optimally allocate physical resource blocks (PRBs) to HetNet users while prioritizing OPs by granting them high gain PRBs according to the severity of their medical state. Thus, empowering the OPs to send their critical data to their healthcare provider with minimized delay. To that end, two optimization approaches are proposed, a weighted sum rate maximization (WSRMax) approach and a proportional fairness (PF) approach. The proposed approaches increased the OPs' average signal to interference plus noise (SINR) by 57% and 95%, respectively. The WSRMax approach increased the system's total SINR to a level higher than that of the PF approach, nevertheless, the PF approach yielded higher SINRs for the OPs, better fairness and a lower margin of error.",21693536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992555,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); INTERNET(grant numbers:EP/H040536/1); STAR Projects(grant numbers:EP/K016873/1); TOWS Projects(grant numbers:EP/S016570/1); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086596,HetNet uplink optimization;MILP;machine learning;patient-centric;network optimization;naïve Bayesian classifier;decision tree;logistic regression;ensemble;6G;resource allocation;spectrum allocation;big data analytics,Optimization;Machine learning;Big Data;Stroke (medical condition);Resource management;Support vector machines;Interference,,42.0,,65.0,CCBY,5 May 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

To fully exploit the benefits of such a distributed architecture, there needs to be a paradigm shift from centralized to distributed management. To enable distributed management, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising choice, due to its ability to learn dynamic changes in environments and to deal with complex problems. However, the deployment of highly distributed RL – termed massive distribution of intelligence – still faces a few unsolved challenges. Existing RL solutions, based on Q-Learning (QL) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) do not scale with the number of agents. Therefore, current limitations, i.e., convergence, system performance and training stability, need to be addressed, to facilitate a practical deployment of massive distribution. To this end, we propose improved Double Deep Q-Network (IDDQN), addressing the long-term stability of the agents’ training behavior. We evaluate the effectiveness of IDDQN for a beyond 5G/6G use case: auto-scaling virtual resources in a network slice. Simulation results show that IDDQN improves the training stability over DQN and converges at least 2 times sooner than QL.

This paper proposes an intelligent scheme aimed at achieving energy-efficient RA in uplink scenarios with unknown interference. Firstly, a novel interference-inference-based RA (IIBRA) framework is proposed to support this scheme. In the framework, the interference relationship between users is precisely modeled by processing the historical operation data of the network. Based on the modeled interference relationship, accurate performance feedback to the RA algorithm is provided. Secondly, a joint double deep Q-network and optimization RA (DORA) algorithm is developed, which decomposes the joint allocation problem into two parts: resource block assignment and power allocation. The two parts continuously interact throughout the allocation process, leading to improved solutions. Thirdly, a new metric called effective energy efficiency (EEE) is provided, which is defined as the product of energy efficiency and average user satisfaction with quality of service (QoS). EEE is used to help train the neural networks, resulting in a superior level of user QoS satisfaction. Numerical results demonstrate that the DORA algorithm achieves a clear enhancement in interference efficiency, surpassing well-known existing algorithms with a maximum improvement of over 50%.

While some slices tolerate the delay and some do not, this versatility of slice services imposes challenges to Mobile Network Operators in designing a robust, scalable, and yet resilient 5GC. Therefore, in this work, we build a self-resilient 5GC that not only addresses the scheduling requirements per slice type but also yields service satisfaction. Precisely, we build it as a combination of large Integer Linear Programming based Column Generation (CG) and Artificial Intelligence based Deep Learning in a Closed Loop Automation with a Self Organizing Network paradigm. During unexpected situations of overload and failures of serving instances, the proposed CG technique in the work improves the scheduling and serving of control plane user requests by dropping 15% lesser user requests in delay-tolerant slices and 5% lesser in delay-sensitive slices, than the existing state-of-the-art solutions. With 95% learning accuracy, the Deep Learning-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method predicts the availability of serving instances of the Network Functions (NFs) of the 5GC.

The proposed framework consists of two-stage cascaded networks, named HestNet and HBFNet, for mmWave channel estimation and hybrid beamforming (HBF) design, respectively. The number of parameters for channel estimation is reduced by using channel covariance matrix (CCM) estimation instead. However, a new challenge of estimating high-dimensional data from low-dimensional data should be considered since the dimension of Sub-6G channel data is much smaller than that of mmWave. Subsequently, a data deformation approach is introduced into the framework to match the size of Sub-6G channel data with that of mmWave. The simulation results show that the application of statistical channel information based on Sub-6G channel information to aid mmWave communication is reasonable and effective, it achieves good estimation performance and spectral efficiency.

To improve efficiency, maritime sector activities are focused on the realization of Smart Shipping (SMS), leveraging 6G Communications, Energy Efficiency (EE) and Machine Learning (ML). However, conventional Centralized Machine Learning (CML) cannot be easily applied in the maritime, mainly due to the drawbacks: (i) prohibitive data communication overhead and bandwidth limitations, since CML requires centralization of massive data through transmissions from heterogeneous sources, (ii) excessive energy consumption associated with massive data transfers, (iii) remarkable transmission errors due to harsh propagation conditions, and (iv) data privacy violation, since the data carries sensitive and commercial information. This article proposes a two-fold Federated Learning (FL) scheme (FedShip) to improve the privacy, EE and communication-efficiency of future 6G maritime networks. FedShip uses the Over-the-Air computation (AirComp) principles to exploit the signal superposition property and ensure that local models are accurately and efficiently combined. Using real data regarding the fuel consumption of multiple cargo ships, we compared the FL performance, building multiple timeseries forecasting models, with collaborative ML baselines. AirComp performance was also assessed using simulation data about channel measurements. After optimizing the hyperparameters of the local models, extensive results revealed that: (i) FL shows enhanced fuel prediction accuracy (95.5% relative to the CML), while ensuring data privacy and (ii) AirComp can be adopted to combine the local models with low computation error, offering significant EE and spectrum efficiency improvements, especially when dense 6G scenarios are considered.",15580016,,10.1109/TITS.2024.3468383,“Trustworthy and Resilient Decentralized Intelligence for Edge Systems ” Project(grant numbers:101093006); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707001,6G communications;federated learning;internet of ships;Internet of Things;machine learning;maritime communications;over-the-air computation;smart shipping,Training;Marine vehicles;Biological system modeling;Data models;Fuels;Accuracy;Data privacy;Atmospheric modeling;6G mobile communication;Energy efficiency,,,,53.0,IEEE,7 Oct 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

However, the stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements for ultra-massive connectivity, limited network resources, and interference management are the significant challenges to deploying multiple device-to-device pairs (DDPs) without disrupting cellular users. Hence, intelligent resource management and power control are indispensable for alleviating interference among DDPs to optimize overall system performance and global energy efficiency. Considering this, we present a Federated DRL-based method for energy-efficient resource management in a D2D-assisted heterogeneous network (HetNet). We formulate a joint optimization problem of power control and channel allocation to maximize the system’s energy efficiency under QoS constraints for cellular user equipment (CUEs) and DDPs. The proposed scheme employs federated learning for a decentralized training paradigm to address user privacy, and a double-deep Q-network (DDQN) is used for intelligent resource management. The proposed DDQN method uses two separate Q-networks for action selection and target estimation to rationalize the transmit power and dynamic channel selection in which DDPs as agents could reuse the uplink channels of CUEs.

Among them, mmWave spectrum exploitation stands out for its ability to deliver ultra-high data rates. However, its full adoption beyond fifth generation multicast systems (5G+/6G) remains hampered, mainly due to mobility robustness issues. In this work, we propose a solution to address the problem of efficient sidelink-assisted multicasting in mobile multimode systems, specifically by considering the possibility of jointly utilizing sidelink/device-to-device (D2D), unicast, and multicast transmissions to improve service delivery. To overcome the complexity problem in finding the optimal solution for user-mode binding, we introduce a pre-optimization step called multicast group formation (MGF). Through a clustering technique based on unsupervised machine learning, MGF allows to reduce the complexity of solving the sidelink-assisted multiple modes mmWave (SA3M) problem. A detailed analysis of the impact of various system parameters on performance is conducted, and numerical evidence of the complexity/performance trade-off and its dependence on mobility patterns and user distribution is provided. Particularly, our proposed solution achieves a network throughput improvement of up to 32% over state-of-the-art schemes while ensuring the lowest computational time.

As one of the 6G cornerstones, Network Slicing (NS) allows the creation of various customized 6G-V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) use cases on the same physical infrastructure. However, 6G-NS advances can open up breaches to cyber-attacks aiming to break 6G-V2X Network slices to inflict maximum damage on CAVs and their users. Crossing borders, where CAVs leave their V2X-NS (V2X Network Slice) in the Home Mobile Network Operator (H-MNO) toward a similar V2X-NS in the Visited MNO (V-MNO), is an attractive opportunity to exploit by attackers. Detecting and mitigating attacks, in this case, becomes a priority, confronted by NS requirements and MNOs not ready to share their private data. To this end, this paper proposes a 3GPP-compliant privacy preservation collaborative learning scheme for 6G-NS security, focusing on V2X-NS cross-border areas. Our scheme leverages multi-process Federated Learning (FL) architecture to build efficient V2X-NS security-related models while preserving 6G V2X-NS isolation.

In this study, we propose a novel energy-efficient resource allocation scheme for 6G NOMA-assisted BackCom networks.

To address this issue, we developed a novel deep-learning-based algorithm that leverages the advantages of deep reinforcement learning. During training, we estimated the state components without relying on exact channel state information (CSI), which is computationally expensive. This estimation reduces the communication overhead raised in collecting CSI data. Extensive simulations were conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme.

To solve the optimization problem, an AI-based framework is proposed to enable a decomposition of the NP-hard problem into two subproblems: 1) a sensing subproblem and 2) a power allocation subproblem. Initially, a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based scheme is utilized to solve the sensing subproblem that identifies the current location of the users with the sensing information.

However, a key challenge lies in the transmission at Terahertz frequencies, which entails significant signal loss, resulting in reduced signal-to-interference and noise ratio margins ( $\Gamma $ ). Increased transmit power can ameliorate  $\Gamma $  and SE, thereby sacrificing EE. Consequently, it necessitates strategic Resource Allocation (RA) to uphold an optimal trade-off amid SE, EE and  $\Gamma $ . In this paper, we propose a series of RA strategic algorithms harnessing the Transfer Learning, Growth-Share (GS) matrix, Game Theory (GT), and service priorities to tailor the aforementioned trade-off. This endeavour renders the network more intelligent, self-sufficient, and resilient. Furthermore, we have seamlessly integrated Device-to-Device communication scenarios into our proposed algorithms, enhancing SE and network capacity. The proposed integration aims to strengthen overall system performance and accommodate the evolving demands of future wireless networks. Our primary contribution lies in the development of the GS-GT-based Optimal PathFinder (GS-GTOPF) algorithm to identify optimal paths based on SE using Deep Neural Networks. Thereafter, we formulate an enhanced version of it by integrating service priorities (GS-GTOPF-SP). This refinement has been further advanced by reducing the Computational Time (CT), resulting in GS-GTOPF-SP-rCT. Further improvement is achieved by introducing the angle criterion (GS-GTOPF-SP-rCT- $\theta $ ). Extensive simulations demonstrate that angle criterion integrated algorithm, showcases a remarkable 76.12% reduction in CT while maintaining an accuracy surpassing 95% compared to GS-GTOPF. Moreover, prioritizing high-priority services leads to a significant enhancement of 12.97% and 62.95% in SE, 16.14% and 81.97% in EE, and 12.27% and 25.95% in  $\Gamma $  when compared to medium and low-priority services.",21693536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3404473,"Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)(grant numbers:EEQ/2020/000047,SIR/2022/00095); University of Hradec Kralove, Faculty of Informatics and Management, Czech Republic Agency of Excellence(grant numbers:2204/2023); International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore, Communications Enterprise Technologies (IIITB COMET) Foundation, established under the Advanced Communication Systems Vertical of the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (NM-ICPS), Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, Chair Professorship from Driving Innovation through Simulation Hub for Technologies in Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (DRISHTI CPS), Ministry of Education, Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (MoE SPARC)(grant numbers:SPARC/2019-2020/P2264/SL); Soochow University, China; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10537167,Terahertz (THz) communication;transferred learning (TL);energy efficiency (EE);spectrum efficiency (SE);signal to interference and noise ratio-margin (Γ);residual battery indicator (RBI),6G mobile communication;Interference;Device-to-device communication;Energy efficiency;Wireless networks;Resource management;Terahertz communications;Transfer learning;Signal to noise ratio,,4.0,,56.0,CCBY,23 May 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

In the context of multiple base stations (BSs), the handover between BSs and user equipment is worthy to be studied. Referring to the concept of coordinated multiples BSs, we design a handover procedures in the ISAC networks. Meanwhile, a federated reinforcement learning scheme of user control is designed.

Joint Optimization Algorithm of Training Delay and Energy Efficiency for Wireless Large-Scale Distributed Machine Learning Combined With Blockchain for 6G Networks,X. Zhang; X.

To solve this problem, a wireless large-scale DML architecture combined with blockchain (WLDMLB) for 6G networks is proposed, where the distributed nodes involved in DML are divided into shards and a layered adaptive cascaded architecture is used in each shard to reduce the communication overhead. To reduce the system energy, improve training efficiency and achieve on-demand networking, a joint optimization model of the number of shards, network topology, and allocation of computing resources is established to ensure that the model can run efficiently on different devices. Then, a closed-form expression of one-round training delay and energy is derived. The optimal number of shards, the optimal network topology and the optimal computing resource allocation are further analysed. In addition, a main-shards blockchain architecture with the directed acyclic graph (DAG) and practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus is proposed to ensure the trusted sharing of model and ensure system scalability.

Knowledge-Collaboration-Based Resource Allocation in 6G IoT: A Graph Attention RL Approach,Z. Huang; F. R. Yu; J. Cai,"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China; School of Information Technology, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada; School of Cyber Security, Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University, Guangzhou, China",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,7 Nov 2024,2024,11.0,22.0,36581,36595,"In future 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT), users and devices will be divided into numerous distributed domains with smaller base station coverage due to the utilization of terahertz high-frequency band communication. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents will be increasingly deployed in the domain to achieve intelligent service provisioning and resource allocation. However, the existing DRL-based method faces the problem of repeated model training and poor generalization ability when service demand fluctuates and environmental changes occur. In addition, limited training samples in each domain also lead to insufficient model training. Inspired by the collaborative learning of human knowledge, we propose a knowledge collaboration-based resource allocation mechanism for future 6G-enabled IoT and address two basic issues: 1) which agent should collaborate with and 2) how to collaborate. Specifically, we first model the distributed network as a graph and use graph attention (GAT) to capture the fluctuant service demands and time-varying resource capacities in temporal and spatial domains, and then calculate the similarity between the agents. We further propose a collective reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithm that facilitates knowledge collaboration between the agents through the policy distribution. Simulation results verify that the proposed GAT-CRL achieves fast convergence as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) in 4K steps, computing the similarity score more accurately with the increasing attention heads, and achieves higher successful flow than the soft actor-critic (about 3.6%–5.4%) and DDPG (about 14.6%–21%) when adapting to unseen traffic patterns/loads and increasing topology scales.",23274662,,10.1109/JIOT.2024.3416054,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902080,61972104,62002072,61702120); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1804403,2018YFB1802200); Special Projects in Key Areas of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B010118001); Science and Technology Project in Guangzhou(grant numbers:201803010081); Foshan Science and Technology Innovation Project, China(grant numbers:2018IT100283); Guangzhou Key Laboratory(grant numbers:202102100006); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China(grant numbers:202002020035); Research Projects in Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021ZDJS026); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10560516,Collective reinforcement learning (CRL);graph attention (GAT);knowledge collaboration;resource allocation,Training;Collaboration;6G mobile communication;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Servers;Computational modeling,,,,50.0,IEEE,18 Jun 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
