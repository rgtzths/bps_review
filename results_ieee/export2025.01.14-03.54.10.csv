Moreover, in wireless topologies characterized by fast varying channels, timely and accurate CSI acquisition might not be possible and the transmitters (CSIT) only have statistical CSI available. This work focuses on the appropriate selection of relaying mode in a cooperative network, comprising a single information source, one buffer-aided (BA) relay with full-duplex (FD) capabilities, and a single destination. Here, prior to each transmission, the relay should select to operate either in FD mode with power control, or, resort to half-duplex (HD) relaying when excessive self-interference (SI) arises.

Existing RL solutions, based on Q-Learning (QL) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) do not scale with the number of agents. Therefore, current limitations, i.e., convergence, system performance and training stability, need to be addressed, to facilitate a practical deployment of massive distribution. To this end, we propose improved Double Deep Q-Network (IDDQN), addressing the long-term stability of the agents’ training behavior. We evaluate the effectiveness of IDDQN for a beyond 5G/6G use case: auto-scaling virtual resources in a network slice. Simulation results show that IDDQN improves the training stability over DQN and converges at least 2 times sooner than QL. In terms of the number of users served by a slice, IDDQN shows good performance and only deviates on average 8% from the optimal solution. Further, IDDQN is robust and resource-efficient after convergence. We argue that IDDQN is a better alternative than QL and DQN, and holds immense potential for efficiently managing 6G networks.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2023.3333875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10323293","6G;network management;network automation;reinforcement learning;machine learning;distributed intelligence;model training stability;scalability","6G mobile communication;Convergence;Training;Scalability;5G mobile communication;Benchmark testing;Behavioral sciences","","2","","54","IEEE","20 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, a novel interference-inference-based RA (IIBRA) framework is proposed to support this scheme. In the framework, the interference relationship between users is precisely modeled by processing the historical operation data of the network.

Hence, we consider a data-driven approach based on graph neural networks. We model the subnetwork deployment as an interference graph and propose an unsupervised learning approach to optimize the sub-band allocation using graph neural networks. This approach is inspired by the graph colouring heuristic and the Potts model. The numerical evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves close performance to the centralized greedy colouring sub-band allocation heuristic with lower computational time complexity.

While some slices tolerate the delay and some do not, this versatility of slice services imposes challenges to Mobile Network Operators in designing a robust, scalable, and yet resilient 5GC. Therefore, in this work, we build a self-resilient 5GC that not only addresses the scheduling requirements per slice type but also yields service satisfaction. Precisely, we build it as a combination of large Integer Linear Programming based Column Generation (CG) and Artificial Intelligence based Deep Learning in a Closed Loop Automation with a Self Organizing Network paradigm. During unexpected situations of overload and failures of serving instances, the proposed CG technique in the work improves the scheduling and serving of control plane user requests by dropping 15% lesser user requests in delay-tolerant slices and 5% lesser in delay-sensitive slices, than the existing state-of-the-art solutions. With 95% learning accuracy, the Deep Learning-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method predicts the availability of serving instances of the Network Functions (NFs) of the 5GC. Overall, by deriving the optimal number of serving instances for each NF of the 5GC, this blend of CG and AI in the 5GC not only contributes to efficient scaling and reconfiguration of the slices but also improves the resilience and High Availability of the 5GC.

The network includes many non-stationary space-air-ground-sea nodes with dynamic, unstable connections and resources, where any node can be in one of two hidden states: i) reliable – when the node generates/propagates no data errors; ii) unreliable – when the node can generate/propagate random errors. We show that solving this problem is challenging, since it represents a non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard dynamic combinatorial optimization problem depending on the unknown distribution of hidden nodes’ states and time-varying parameters (connections and resources of nodes) which can only be observed locally. To tackle these challenges, we develop a new deep learning (DL) model based on the message passing graph neural network (MPNN) to estimate hidden nodes’ states in dynamic network environments. We then propose a novel algorithm based on the integration of MPNN-based DL and online alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) – extension of the well-known classical “static” ADMM to dynamic settings, where the slicing problem is solved distributedly, in real time, based on local information. We prove that our algorithm converges to a global optimum of our problem with a superior performance even in the highly-dynamic, unreliable scenarios.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2023.3262514","Department of Education of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021KTSCX110); National Research Foundation; Singapore and Infocomm Media Development Authority; Future Communications Research Development; DSO National Laboratories; AI Singapore; AISG(grant numbers:AISG2-RP-2020-019); Energy Research Test-Bed and Industry Partnership Funding Initiative; DesCartes and the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research(grant numbers:18H03212); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10083276","6G;deep learning;dynamic combinatorial optimization;graph neural networks;graph theory;mathematical decomposi-tion;multi-access edge computing;network slicing;space-air-ground-sea networks;ultra-reliable low-latency communi-cations","6G mobile communication;Reliability;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamic scheduling;Optimization;Network topology;Quality of service","","8","","114","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle these challenges, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the flourishing generative AI, emerges as a potential solution. In this article, we discuss emerging prerequisites for wireless network digital twins, considering the complicated network architecture, tremendous network scale, extensive coverage, and diversified application scenarios in the 6G era. We further explore the applications of generative AI, such as transformer and diffusion models, to empower the 6G digital twin from multiple perspectives, including physical-digital modeling, synchronization, and slicing capability.

Therefore, the infrastructure of 6G smart cities has become an important topic. Many types and data priorities exist in 6G smart cities; therefore, data traffic management is challenging. Current solutions may face challenges adjusting to swiftly evolving network circumstances and the unexpected rise of time-sensitive data. They require flexibility to handle non-periodic, unforeseen, and time-sensitive traffic, such as mission-critical applications. While current research explores the combination of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and 5G, the evolution to 6G also necessitates the integration of TSN and DT technology to achieve deterministic networking. Therefore, taking advantage of DT in data traffic management, we propose a DT-enabled traffic shaping architecture called Digi-infrastructure, consisting of an intelligent traffic shaper inspired by TSN. Our proposed shaper comprises two components: the first component is a frame classification method established on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address the dynamic scheduling problem by minimising the end-to-end delay. The second component is an intelligent gate control mechanism that considers the time, queue status and specified transmission time of traffic classes according to priority based on latency requirements without using a gate control list or timing data gate control. Finally, our solution improves infrastructure connectivity, efficiency, and latency.","2471-2833","","10.1109/MCOMSTD.0002.2300027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10666454","","6G mobile communication;Smart cities;Mission critical systems;Packet loss;Logic gates;Dynamic scheduling;Delays;Digital systems;Telecommunication traffic","","2","","15","IEEE","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This issue is particularly exacerbated in hotspot areas. To address this problem, we introduce an aerial network integrated with terrestrial UC-RAN to provide coverage to users which are not served by the terrestrial network. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key configuration and optimization parameters (COPs) such as location, transmit power, altitude and beamwidth of aerial base stations (ABS) on system key performance indicators (KPIs) such as coverage, latency satisfaction, average spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. We formulate a robust multi-objective function to maximize these KPIs without biasing towards any specific KPI(s). Finally, we propose a deep reinforcement learning optimization framework based on the state-of-the-art soft actor-critic algorithm to control ABS COPs and optimize system KPIs.

This hierarchical decision-making strategy ensures a structured bargaining mechanism where leaders optimize their revenue by setting resource pricing and followers strategically decide on their resource-buying strategies. In the proposed scheme, the blockchain includes smart contracts that autonomously execute resource trading agreements, ensuring that transactions are tamper-proof and executed according to predefined rules. The proposed method optimizes the system’s utility by dynamically adjusting the pricing strategy to changing resource demands. The simulation results show that our proposed HMADRL algorithm increases the utility by 19.645%, 33.018%, and 48.791% compared to the modified multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), MADDPG, and DDPG algorithms, respectively.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2024.3512581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10783015","Aerial-MEC;consortium blockchain;HMADRL;Metaverse;network slicing;resource trading;Stackelberg game;TN-NTN","Resource management;Blockchains;6G mobile communication;Games;Consumer electronics;Dynamic scheduling;Vehicle dynamics;Security;Artificial intelligence;Computer architecture","","","","","IEEE","9 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This is especially true in applications that integrate both VR and non-VR modes. The focus on 6G highlights its capacity to cater to these varying requirements, ensuring high-quality video transmission across different platforms and user experiences. This paper introduces two novel algorithms: Separated Input Differentiated Output (SIDO) and Merged Input Differentiated Output (MIDO). These algorithms are designed to optimize resolution and power allocations in downlink wireless communication, catering to both non-VR and VR users within a chunk-based structure. By encapsulating diverse parameters like subjective perceptual video quality, chunk success rate, and cybersickness into our comprehensive QoE model, we present an approach to address challenges inherent to 360° video optimization.

To support such heterogeneous services, mobile network operators (MNOs) utilize a network sharing configuration known as the multi-operator core network that allows MNOs to share their radio access networks and spectrum resources. The goal is to ensure the minimum data rate requirement for eMBB users and guarantee the delay and reliability requirements for URLLC users. Also, leveraging stochastic geometry, a statistical quality of service analysis is provided for eMBB and URLLC users.

UAVs cache popular contents and collaboratively share with each other. The optimization problem of joint caching decision, 3D trajectory planning and spectrum resource allocation is formulated for minimizing the system content retrieving delay.

However, due to the untrusted and broadcast nature of wireless transmission among communicating MDs and computing resource providers, ensuring the security of resource transactions will be challenging. Blockchain-based resource-sharing systems have been proposed to address security issues. However, these systems use existing consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work that consume massive amounts of system resources. In addressing this, some studies attempted to use single-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in leader selection. Nevertheless, these solutions overlooked the intelligence and flexibility of blockchain configuration, and a single-point of failure can cause the system to fail.

The Digital Twin (DT) concept, especially consolidated in the industrial domains, is gaining momentum as a key enabler of 6G. By interacting in real time with the paired physical network components (e.g., end-devices, routers, base stations, edge servers), Network DTs (NDTs) can monitor, predict and optimize their performance, without affecting their actual behaviour. In particular, in recent years, NDTs have been devised to be coupled with MEC servers to track their state and assist, among others, in resource allocation, task offloading and service migration optimization policies. Notwithstanding, to the best of our knowledge, it is unclear how the DT of a MEC server should be built, in terms of data models, functions and interfaces, and where it should be placed. In order to fill this gap, in this work we design a reference architecture for MEC NDTs along with the relevant components needed to support the main MEC operations and identify possible guidelines for the placement of such NDTs.","","979-8-3503-0948-5","10.1109/MeditCom61057.2024.10621300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10621300","Network Digital Twin;MEC server;6G","6G mobile communication;Real-time systems;Data models;Digital twins;Servers;Resource management;Task analysis","","","","35","IEEE","12 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates distributed dynamic channel allocation to mitigate inter-subnetwork interference in dense in-factory deployments of 6G in-X subnetworks. This paper introduces two new techniques, Federated Multi-Agent Double Deep Q-Network (F-MADDQN) and Federated Multi-Agent Deep Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MADPPO), for channel allocation in 6G in-X subnetworks. These techniques are based on a client-to-server horizontal federated reinforcement learning framework. The methods require sharing only local model weights with a centralized gNB for federated aggregation thereby preserving local data privacy and security. Simulations were conducted using a practical indoor factory environment proposed by 5G-ACIA and 3GPP models for in-factory environments. The results showed that the proposed methods achieved slightly better performance than baseline schemes with significantly reduced signaling overhead compared to the baseline solutions.

HAPs and UAVs can efficiently extend the network coverage which is unfeasible by ground base stations. However, due to the high dynamic nature of air ground communications, both the available network resource and channel state information (CSI) are time varying which is typically called the dilemma of information uncertainty, often making the resource allocation intractable. To overcome the challenges, first we propose an air ground integrated 6G heterogeneous network (AGIN 6G) leveraging the wide coverage of HAPs and the hot spot communication enhancement of UAVs. Second we formulate the challenge as a three-sided matching problem with the size and cyclic preference (TMSC) among HAPs, UAVs and users. To find a feasible solution, we transform the problem into a R-TMSC issue by applying some reasonable constraints, especially when the CSI is assumed known, we can develop the HOR$^{2}$ A-CSI algorithm. Third, to cope with the information uncertainty, we propose the CVA-UCB matching solution augmented with machine learning. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments comparing with benchmark algorithms. Our works can verify that the proposed algorithm is superior to others in terms of the data transmission rate, system revenue and throughput.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2023.3325356","Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(grant numbers:F2022502017); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201212); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2023JC003); Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Medical Electronics and Digital Health(grant numbers:MEDH202215); Baoding Fundamental Research Project(grant numbers:2272P003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10288222","Air ground integrated 6G heterogeneous networks (AGIN 6G);matching learning;resource allocation;three-sided cyclic matching","6G mobile communication;Resource management;Uncertainty;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Machine learning algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Throughput","","3","","49","IEEE","19 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Endless resource pools aim at supporting end-users by exposing them to a range of services and infrastructures available to meet their real-time requirements. Yet, the number of feasible options and combinations that resource pools can offer end-users makes it difficult for them to allocate and manage such a large amount of resources. This challenge has been emphasized through the novel paradigm boosted by 6G networks, Cloud Continuum, that integrates resources across various network domains (Extreme Edge, Edge, and Cloud) and faces pending challenges in managing distributed infrastructure resources. Nonetheless, the lack of trust and uncertainty, especially when using services from unfamiliar stakeholders, is still present, affecting end-users’ decision-making. Thus, this article introduces a Level of Trust Assessment Function (LoTAF) for efficient resource and infrastructure management within the Cloud Continuum in 6G networks. LoTAF serves as a neutral and intelligent service to assess trust levels in network services, ensuring trustworthy end-to-end (E2E) connections across multiple domains and providers. By incorporating trust as a novel intent, LoTAF allows stakeholders to manifest needs and manage resources using insights from historical data and ongoing exploration, expressed in semi-natural language. Additionally, we also introduce the Trust Level Agreement (TLA) concept, evolving from traditional Service Level Agreements (SLAs), to incorporate stakeholder trust levels and display both LoTAF and TLA in a 6G-oriented scenario.","2575-4912","979-8-3503-4499-8","10.1109/EuCNC/6GSummit60053.2024.10597051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10597051","","6G mobile communication;Uncertainty;Wireless networks;Decision making;Buildings;Real-time systems;Stakeholders","","","","17","IEEE","19 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Channel measurements cannot cover all scenarios and frequency bands for 6G, and conventional models lack accurate predictive capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel 6G space-time joint predictive channel model to predict channels in the space-time domains, which can rebuild lost measurement data and correct abnormal data. The proposed model designs a space-time generative adversarial network (STGAN) framework, conditioned on channel large-scale and small-scale characteristics, to synthesize sufficient space-time channel datasets, effectively overcoming data shortages. Accompanied by path identification and characteristic classification, the coupled gated recurrent unit (GRU) framework conducts precise predictions for unknown channels in the space-time domains. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed model's superiority over other methods, including the geometry-based stochastic channel model (GBSM), GRU, long short-term memory (LSTM), and radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN). The model's effectiveness can be attributed to its architecture to capture complex space-time variations and accurately predict non-linear channel characteristics based on continuous measurements. Validation on both indoor and outdoor channel measurements further confirms the model's generality and accuracy. The proposed model provides a robust solution in the space-time joint channel prediction for advanced wireless communications.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2024.3367386","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB2903800); Key Technologies R&D Program of Jiangsu(grant numbers:BE2022067,BE2022067-1); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2242022k60006,2242023K5003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61960206006,62271147,62301364,62301151); EU H2020 RISE TESTBED2 project(grant numbers:872172); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST(grant numbers:2022QNRC001); Start-up Research Fund of Southeast University(grant numbers:RF1028623062); High-end Foreign Experts Introduction(grant numbers:G2023014110); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10461110","6G wireless communications;channel space-time joint characteristics;generative adversarial network;machine learning;predictive channel modeling","6G mobile communication;Predictive models;Channel estimation;Wireless communication;Channel models;Data models;Generative adversarial networks","","1","","49","IEEE","8 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such trends bring both new challenges and opportunities for the practical design of 6G. On one hand, acquiring channel state information (CSI) in real time for all wireless links becomes quite challenging in 6G. On the other hand, there would be numerous data sources in 6G containing high-quality location-tagged channel data, e.g., the estimated channels or beams between base station (BS) and user equipment (UE), making it possible to better learn the local wireless environment. By exploiting this new opportunity and for tackling the CSI acquisition challenge, there is a promising paradigm shift from the conventional environment-unaware communications to the new environment-aware communications based on the novel approach of channel knowledge map (CKM). This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview on environment-aware communications enabled by CKM to fully harness its benefits for 6G. First, the basic concept of CKM is presented, followed by the comparison of CKM with various existing channel inference techniques. Next, the main techniques for CKM construction are discussed, including both environment model-free and environment model-assisted approaches. Furthermore, a general framework is presented for the utilization of CKM to achieve environment-aware communications, followed by some typical CKM-aided communication scenarios.

We formulate the user association problem as a binary integer programming problem and solve it by using the Gurobi optimizer. Meanwhile, the trajectory and power allocation problem is solved by the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method to cope with the problem’s non-convexity and dynamic network environments.

This paper proposes an intellicise model transmission architecture to guarantee the reliable transmission of models for semantic communication. The mathematical relationship between model size and performance is formulated by employing a recognition error function supported with experimental data. We consider the characteristics of wireless channels and derive the closed-form expression of model transmission outage probability (MTOP) over the Rayleigh channel. Besides, we define the effective model accuracy (EMA) to evaluate the model transmission performance of both communication and intelligence.

Moreover, the propagation of signals with ultra-high frequencies, such as millimetre waves and terahertz communications, is severely affected by obstacles. To address these issues, the Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS), which consists of nearly passive elements, has gained popularity because of its ability to intelligently reconfigure signal propagation in an energy-efficient manner.

To improve efficiency, maritime sector activities are focused on the realization of Smart Shipping (SMS), leveraging 6G Communications, Energy Efficiency (EE) and Machine Learning (ML). However, conventional Centralized Machine Learning (CML) cannot be easily applied in the maritime, mainly due to the drawbacks: (i) prohibitive data communication overhead and bandwidth limitations, since CML requires centralization of massive data through transmissions from heterogeneous sources, (ii) excessive energy consumption associated with massive data transfers, (iii) remarkable transmission errors due to harsh propagation conditions, and (iv) data privacy violation, since the data carries sensitive and commercial information. This article proposes a two-fold Federated Learning (FL) scheme (FedShip) to improve the privacy, EE and communication-efficiency of future 6G maritime networks. FedShip uses the Over-the-Air computation (AirComp) principles to exploit the signal superposition property and ensure that local models are accurately and efficiently combined. Using real data regarding the fuel consumption of multiple cargo ships, we compared the FL performance, building multiple timeseries forecasting models, with collaborative ML baselines. AirComp performance was also assessed using simulation data about channel measurements. After optimizing the hyperparameters of the local models, extensive results revealed that: (i) FL shows enhanced fuel prediction accuracy (95.5% relative to the CML), while ensuring data privacy and (ii) AirComp can be adopted to combine the local models with low computation error, offering significant EE and spectrum efficiency improvements, especially when dense 6G scenarios are considered.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2024.3468383","“Trustworthy and Resilient Decentralized Intelligence for Edge Systems ” Project(grant numbers:101093006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707001","6G communications;federated learning;internet of ships;Internet of Things;machine learning;maritime communications;over-the-air computation;smart shipping","Training;Marine vehicles;Biological system modeling;Data models;Fuels;Accuracy;Data privacy;Atmospheric modeling;6G mobile communication;Energy efficiency","","","","53","IEEE","7 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We aim to minimize the long-term average total service delay of all the V-UEs by jointly optimizing the offloading decisions of all the V-UEs, the computation resource allocation at the ISAC-aided RSU, the transmission power, and the allocation of resource blocks for all the V-UEs, where the total service delay of a V-UE includes the task processing delay and the transmission delay if the V-UE offloads its task to the RSU. To solve the formulated mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, we design a multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-based offloading optimization and resource allocation algorithm (MADDPG-O2RA2).

Recently, UAVs have been used as flying relays to support terrestrial cellular networks for enhancing coverage and connectivity. Multiple UAVs serve as data collectors at a common altitude in a UAV-aided Internet of Things (IoT) network. Data collected is processed by Federated Learning (FL) before being sent to central servers to protect users’ privacy and reduce communication costs. Batteries in UAVs are tiny and efficient only for a short duration, making FL challenging to execute for many iterations. Therefore, a Multi-UAV Energy Efficient Coverage Deployment algorithm based on a Spatial Adaptive Play (MUECD-SAP) is proposed in this article. MUECD uses a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize the accurate location of deployed UAVs based on the Signal-toInterference Ratio (SINR) to increase the data collection rate. Also, to make the FL run for multiple iterations, SAP dynamically allocates resources using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to optimize the energy consumed and the link latency between the user and the UAV system. The proposed MUECD algorithm outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms by achieving an improved data rate and balanced SINR value. The proposed SAP resource allocation strategy has improved the FL execution by 66.67% and attains a very low latency and energy consumed compared to other resource allocation techniques.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2024.3390226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10504793","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles;Coverage Optimization;Resource Allocation;Internet of Things;Federated Learning;Deep Reinforcement Learning","Autonomous aerial vehicles;Internet of Things;Resource management;6G mobile communication;Data collection;Signal to noise ratio;Servers","","","","","IEEE","17 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As the fifth generation (5G) of mobile communications is currently in operation and 5G-advanced is on the horizon, the objective of this paper is to assess prominent channel coding schemes in the context of recent advancements and the anticipated requirements for the sixth generation (6G). In this paper, after considering the potential impact of channel coding on key performance indicators (KPIs) of wireless networks, we review the evolution of mobile communication standards and the organizations involved in the standardization, from the first generation (1G) to the current 5G, highlighting the technologies integral to achieving targeted KPIs such as reliability, data rate, latency, energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, connection density, and traffic capacity. Following this, we delve into the anticipated requirements for potential use cases in 6G. The subsequent sections of the paper focus on a comprehensive review of three primary coding schemes utilized in past generations and their recent advancements: low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, turbo codes (including convolutional codes), and polar codes (alongside Reed-Muller codes).
