Intelligent Radio Access Network Slicing for Service Provisioning in 6G: A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,J. Mei; X. Wang; K. Zheng; G. Boudreau; A. B. Sediq; H.

Unfortunately, effective slicing of Radio Access Networks (RAN) is still challenging due to time-varying network situations. This paper proposes a new intelligent RAN slicing strategy with two-layered control granularity, which aims at maximizing both the long-term QoS of services and spectrum efficiency (SE) of slices. The proposed method consists of an upper-level controller to ensure the QoS performance, which enforces loose control by performing adaptive slice configuration according to the long-term dynamics of service traffic. The lower-level controller is to improve SE of slices, by tightly scheduling radio resources to users at the small time-scale. To realize the proposed RAN slicing strategy, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is a hierarchical structure that collaboratively integrating the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and double deep-Q-network algorithm. Specifically, the lower-level control problem is a mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem with multiple constraints. This kind of problem is hard to be directly solved by the exiting DRL algorithms, since it involves searching for the solution in a vast set of mixed-integer action space, which will induce unbearable computational complexity. Thus, we propose a novel action space reducing approach, embedding the convex optimization tools into the DDPG algorithm, to speed up the lower-level control. Furthermore, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent RAN slicing scheme.",1558-0857,,10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3090423,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Program(grant numbers:RGPIN2018-06254); Canada Research Chair Program; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9459763,Network slicing;5G beyond;6G;deep reinforcement learning;and radio resource management,Quality of service;Network slicing;Stochastic processes;Resource management;Optimization;Mathematical model;Dynamic scheduling,,84.0,,34.0,IEEE,18 Jun 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
Customized Slicing for 6G: Enforcing Artificial Intelligence on Resource Management,W. Guan; H. Zhang; V. C. M. Leung,"University of Science and Technology, Beijing, China; University of Science and Technology, Beijing, China; Shenzhen University, China",IEEE Network,8 Nov 2021,2021,35.0,5.0,264,271,"Next generation wireless networks are expected to support diverse vertical industries and offer countless emerging use cases. To satisfy stringent requirements of diversified services, network slicing is developed, which enables service-oriented resource allocation by tailoring the infrastructure network into multiple logical networks. However, there are still some challenges in cross-domain multi-dimensional resource management for end-to-end (E2E) slices under the dynamic and uncertain environment. Trading off the revenue and cost of resource allocation while guaranteeing service quality is significant to tenants. Therefore, this article introduces a hierarchical resource management framework, utilizing deep reinforcement learning in admission control of resource requests from different tenants and resource adjustment within admitted slices for each tenant. In particular, we first discuss the challenges in customized resource management of 6G. Second, the motivation and background are presented to explain why artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in resource customization of multi-tenant slicing. Third, E2E resource management is decomposed into two problems, multi-dimensional resource allocation decision based on slice-level feedback, and real-time slice adaption aimed at avoiding service quality degradation.

In this context, energy efficiency becomes a critical challenge to be solved for harnessing these promising applications to realize “green” 6G networks. As a remedy, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been proposed for improving energy efficiency by beneficially reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. In conventional RIS solutions, however, the received signal-to-in-terference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) sometimes may become degraded. This is because the signals impinging on an RIS are typically contaminated by interfering signals that are usually dynamic and unknown. To address this issue, “learning” the properties of the surrounding spectral environment is a promising solution, motivating the convergence of artificial intelligence and spectrum sensing, referred to here as spectrum learning (SL). Inspired by this, we develop an SL-aided RIS framework for intelligently exploiting the inherent characteristics of the radio frequency spectrum for green 6G networks. Given the proposed framework, the RIS controller becomes capable of intelligently “thinking and deciding” whether or not to reflect the incident signals. Therefore, the received SINR can be improved by dynamically configuring the binary ON-OFF status of the RIS elements. The energy efficiency benefits attained are validated with the aid of a specific case study.

One of the major research focuses of 6G is to enable massive Internet of Things (mIoT) applications. Like Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax), forthcoming wireless communication networks are likely to meet massively deployed devices and extremely new smart applications such as smart cities for mIoT. However, channel scarcity is still present due to a massive number of connected devices accessing the common spectrum resources. With this expectation, next-generation Wi-Fi 6 and beyond for mIoT are anticipated to have inherent machine intelligence capabilities to access the optimum channel resources for their performance optimization. Unfortunately, current wireless communication network standards do not support the ensuing needs of machine learning (ML)-aware frameworks in terms of resource allocation optimization. Keeping such an issue in mind, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based, one of the ML techniques, a framework for a wireless channel access mechanism for IEEE 802.11 standards (i.e., Wi-Fi) in mIoT. The proposed mechanism suggests exploiting a practically measured channel collision probability as a collected dataset from the wireless environment to select optimal resource allocation in mIoT for upcoming 6G wireless communications.",2471-2833,,10.1109/MCOMSTD.001.2000055,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9464923,,6G mobile communication;Wireless sensor networks;5G mobile communication;Wireless networks;IEEE 802.11ax Standard;Throughput;Resource management,,18.0,,15.0,IEEE,25 Jun 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Magazines

Conventionally, IoT/edge devices need to transmit data directly to the base station for training the model using machine learning techniques. The data transmission introduces privacy issues that might lead to security concerns and monetary losses. Recently, federated learning was proposed to partially solve privacy issues via model sharing with the base station. However, the centralized nature of federated learning only allows the devices within the vicinity of base stations to share trained models. Furthermore, the long-range communication compels the devices to increase transmission power, which raises energy efficiency concerns. In this work, we propose the distributed federated learning (DBFL) framework that overcomes the connectivity and energy efficiency issues for distant devices. The DBFL framework is compatible with mobile edge computing architecture that connects the devices in a distributed manner using clustering protocols.

In the context of 6G, more computing resources are required, a problem that is dealt with by Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). However, due to the dynamic change of service demands from various locations, the limitation of available computing resources of MEC, and the increase in the number and complexity of IoE services, intelligent resource provisioning for multiple applications is vital. To address this challenging issue, we propose in this paper IScaler, a novel intelligent and proactive IoE resource scaling and service placement solution. IScaler is tailored for MEC and benefits from the new advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Multiple requirements are considered in the design of IScaler's Markov Decision Process. These requirements include the prediction of the resource usage of scaled applications, the prediction of available resources by hosting servers, performing combined horizontal and vertical scaling, as well as making service placement decisions. The use of DRL to solve this problem raises several challenges that prevent the realization of IScaler's full potential, including exploration errors and long learning time. These challenges are tackled by proposing an architecture that embeds an Intelligent Scaling and Placement module (ISP). ISP utilizes IScaler and an optimizer based on heuristics as a bootstrapper and backup.

That means, unless new degrees of freedom and intelligent dynamic adaptability is added, any significant gain in SE must come at the cost of EE. Even the most predominant approaches for capacity enhancement such as network densification yield gains in SE at the cost of increased energy consumption. Moreover, in future mobile networks, the key challenge is not only the rampantly growing volume of traffic, but also the spatiotemporal variability of the traffic. These observations call for a paradigm shift in the way cellular networks are designed and operated. Therefore, in this work, we propose a new cellular architecture called SpiderNet: Spectrally Efficient and Energy Efficient Data Aided Demand Driven Elastic Architecture for 6G Wireless Networks. The key idea behind SpiderNet is to introduce additional degrees of freedom to relax the tight coupling between the SE and EE and database-aided intelligence to enable dynamic adaptive operation for simultaneous enhancement of both SE and EE. This goal is achieved by shifting the pivot of operation from the rigid always ON BS centric cells to user centric (UC) on demand cells.

However, an extraordinary amount of energy will be consumed by network infrastructure, while functions of massively deployed Internet of Everything (IoE) devices are limited by embedded batteries. Therefore, energy self-sustainable (ESS) 6G is proposed in this article. First of all, it may achieve network-wide energy efficiency by exploiting cell-free and airborne access networks as well as by implementing intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). Second, by exploiting radio-frequency/visible-light signals for on-demand wireless information and energy provision (WIEP) and for enabling passive backscatter communication, “zero-energy” IoE devices may become a reality. Furthermore, IoE devices actively adapt their transceivers for better performance to a dynamic environment.

To acquire the channel quality information, pilot (or reference) signals are commonly transmitted, measured, and reported to the network. However, the process of channel quality acquisition is both time and energy consuming. Moreover, the radio resources are competitively shared by the pilot signals and users' data. This motivates an employment of prediction-based approaches determining the channel quality at low cost to avoid over-consumption of resources for pilots. Machine learning is seen as an efficient way to deal with the channel quality prediction, since it allows to reveal usually hidden relations among known and unknown channel quality measurements. In this article, we first overview state-of-the-art works leveraging the time, frequency, and spatial correlations among already known channel qualities and the channel(s), whose quality should be predicted.

However, RL-based solutions are still not widely adopted in commercial cellular networks. One of the primary reasons for this is the slow convergence of RL agents when they are deployed in a live network and when the network’s context changes significantly. Concurrently, the open radio access network (O-RAN) paradigm promises to give mobile network operators (MNOs) more control over their networks, furthering the need for intelligent and RL-based network management. O-RAN’s standardized interfaces will allow MNOs to make real-time custom changes to intelligently control various RRM functionalities. We consider a RAN slicing scenario in which MNOs can modify the weights of the RL reward function. This enables MNOs to change the priorities of fulfilling the service level agreements of the slices. However, this results in a practical challenge since the RL agent needs to adapt promptly to the changes made by the MNO. This challenge is addressed in this paper, where we first present and discuss the results from an exhaustive experiment to examine the efficiency of using transfer learning (TL) to accelerate the convergence of RL-based RAN slicing in the considered scenario. We then propose a novel predictive approach to enhance the TL-based acceleration by selecting the best-saved policy for reuse. By adopting the proposed policy transfer approach, RL agents are able to converge up to 14000 learning steps faster than their non-accelerated counterparts. The proposed machine learning (ML)-based predictive approach also shows up to a 96.5% accuracy in selecting the best expert policy to reuse for acceleration.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2023.3258692,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:RGPIN-2019-05667,RGPIN-2021-04050); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10075524,O-RAN;RAN slicing;resource allocation;predictive transfer learning;accelerated reinforcement learning;6G,Resource management;Next generation networking;Convergence;Radio access networks;Wireless networks;Accelerated aging;Knowledge engineering,,8.0,,37.0,IEEE,17 Mar 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Despite the promising performance of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in network slicing, lack of transparency, interpretability, and opaque model concerns impedes users from trusting the DRL agent decisions or predictions. This problem becomes even more pronounced when there is a need to provision highly reliable and secure services. Leveraging eXplainable AI (XAI) in conjunction with an explanation-guided approach, we propose an eXplainable reinforcement learning (XRL) scheme to surmount the opaqueness of black-box DRL. The core concept behind the proposed method is the intrinsic interpretability of the reward hypothesis aiming to encourage DRL agents to learn the best actions for specific network slice states while coping with conflict-prone and complex relations of stateaction pairs. To validate the proposed framework, we target a resource allocation optimization problem where multi-agent XRL strives to allocate optimal available radio resources to meet the SLA requirements of slices. Finally, we present numerical results to showcase the superiority of the adopted XRL approach over the DRL baseline. As far as we know, this is the first work that studies the feasibility of an explanation-guided DRL approach in the context of 6G networks.",2694-2941,979-8-3503-3307-7,10.1109/ICCWorkshops57953.2023.10283684,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10283684,6G;network slicing;AI;XAI;XRL;resource allocation,6G mobile communication;Deep learning;Network slicing;Conferences;Wireless networks;Reinforcement learning;Resource management,,7.0,,13.0,IEEE,23 Oct 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, due to the dynamic mobility of wireless subnetworks, the data transmission of intra-subnetwork and inter-subnetwork will inevitably interfere with each other, which poses a great challenge to radio resource management. Moreover, most existing approaches require the instantaneous channel gain between subnetworks, which are usually difficult to be collected. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose a novel effective intelligent radio resource management method using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL), which only needs the sum of received power, named received signal strength indicator (RSSI), on each channel instead of channel gains. However, to directly separate individual interference from RSSI is an almost impossible thing. To this end, we further propose a novel MARL architecture, named GA-Net, which integrates a hard attention layer to model the importance distribution of inter-subnetwork relationships based on RSSI and excludes the impact of unrelated subnetworks, and employs a graph attention network with a multi-head attention layer to exact the features and calculate their weights that will impact individual throughput.

The two techniques can support each other to increase the performance of the 6G system. In a RIS-aided system, channel estimation is a challenging problem, especially when applying passive RIS which has no signal processing. This paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-based channel estimation method using a convolutional long-short term memory (CNN-LSTM) model for RIS-NOMA wireless communication systems that integrate RIS and NOMA techniques. CNN-LSTM leverages both the benefits of convolutional neural network (CNN) as well as long-short term memory (LSTM), in which CNN can capture special features while LSTM can capture temporal features of time-series data. The simulation results indicate that the proposed CNN-LSTM model shows its robustness toward the variation of the RIS-NOMA system parameters, i.e., transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), power allocation factor, and the number of RIS elements. The impacts of the RIS-NOMA system parameters on the prediction accuracy of the proposed DL-based channel estimation methods are evaluated via different performance metrics. The results reveal that the performance accuracy in terms of normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), coefficient of determination R-squared score (R2 score), mean absolute scaled error (MASE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) increases with an increased transmit SNR, power allocation factor of the first user and the number of RIS elements.

Among them, services such as remote surgery and intelligent manufacturing are sensitive to delay and have high requirements for delay certainty. In order to meet the needs of delay-sensitive services, 3GPP defined the technical solution of 5G network as a TSN bridge in version R16 to support deterministic services of mobile networks. However, this solution has technical shortcomings, for example, it does not support aperiodic service scheduling, and does not define a coordination mechanism between applications and networks. Therefore, this paper sorts out the promotion process of 3GPP supporting mobile deterministic networks, clarifies the reasons for the existence of problems, and provides a GCN-based hierarchical reinforcement learning model to flexibly handle dynamic and diverse traffic for 6G networks.

However, the heterogeneous nature of these services' requirements, along with the limited RAN resources, makes RAN slicing very complex. Indeed, the challenge that mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) face is to rapidly adapt their RAN slicing strategies to the frequent changes of the environment constraints and service requirements. Machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), are increasingly considered a key enabler for automating the management and orchestration of RAN slicing operations. Nerveless, the ability to generalize DRL models to multiple RAN slicing environments may be limited due to their strong dependence on the environment data on which they are trained. Federated learning enables MVNOs to leverage more diverse training inputs for DRL without the high cost of collecting this data from different RANs. In this article, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning approach for Open RAN Slicing. In this approach, MVNOs collaborate to improve the performance of their DRL-based RAN slicing models. Each MVNO trains a DRL model and sends it for aggregation. The aggregated model is then sent back to each MVNO for immediate use and further training.

However, one of the biggest difference between the sixth generation (6G) and its predecessor is the ability to support high speed connectivity of mobile services for global coverage, especially focusing on under-connected areas (e.g., forests, oceans, deserts, and mountains). Integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) provide the best solution to unravel the unconnected issues of isolated areas not only on the ground but also in the air and on the sea.

However, existing research on RIC only focuses on the implementation of interfaces and progress, while ignoring the resource allocation between near-RT RIC and non-RT RIC which is essential for ultra-low latency in 6G networks. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based resource allocation scheme that minimizes service latency by optimizing requests allocated and processed between near-RT RIC and non-RT RIC. Specifically, we aim at improving the request acceptance and minimum the average service latency, in our policy, we apply the Double DQN to decide whether the requests are processed at near-RT RIC or non-RT RIC and then allocate the near-RT RIC resource to finish the requests. Firstly, we define and formulate the resource allocation problem in RIC by the Markov decision process framework. Then we propose an allocation scheme based on the Double Deep Q network technique (Double DQN), with two variations (Double DQN with cache and Double DQN without cache) for handling different request types. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in offering the maximum reward.

With the rapid growth of transmission rate requirements and link numbers in the wireless communication network, how to allocate resources reasonably and further improve spectrum utilization challenges the traditional approaches. To address these problems, technologies such as device-to-device (D2D) communication and machine learning (ML) are introduced to the traditional cellular communication network to improve network performance. However, due to the interference caused by spectrum reusing, efficient resource allocation for both cellular users and D2D users is necessary.

In the 5G network, network slicing techniques that enable the isolated management of multiple virtual networks are devised for ensuring quality-of-service (QoS). However, existing network slicing frameworks are inherently insufficient to provide guaranteed performance to those new network services. Even with ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), low-level performance pertaining to the delivery of radio frames or packets rather than service-level performance has only been dealt with, although there exists a large gap between them. The discrepancy comes from the fact that none of those services runs based on the packets. They run based on their own application data units (ADUs) whose size is dynamic and mostly much larger than just a packet. In this regard, in order to directly guarantee the service-level performance, we propose a new slice management and orchestration framework that can make the time duration to complete the transmission (i.e., completion time) of variable ADUs over fluctuating wireless channels constant through two techniques leveraging the knowledge of ADUs: a time budget orchestration and a radio resource management for ADU completion.

To compete for digital supremacy and to be seen as front-runners in the international technological race, researchers from various regions and countries have begun exploring the technical requirements, envisioning potential applications, identifying innovative enablers, developing testbeds for the preliminary validation of several terrestrial and non-terrestrial technologies, and conceptualizing the architectural design for the next generation of mobile communication systems – the sixth-generation (6G) – aiming to connect the human, physical, and digital worlds with a high level of intelligence and openness for the 2030s. In support of such an ambitious vision, this article extends the end-to-end network slicing concepts, methods, solutions, and functioning architectures towards 6G. To this intent, the study first presents several decisive motivating trends behind such an extension of network slicing in order to make forthcoming mobile networks fully slicing-aware.

In many scenarios, the learning task is performed in the Cloud, while experience samples are generated directly by edge nodes or users. Therefore, the learning task involves some data exchange which, in turn, subtracts a certain amount of transmission resources from the system. This creates a friction between the need to speed up convergence towards an effective strategy, which requires the allocation of resources to transmit learning samples, and the need to maximize the amount of resources used for data plane communication, maximizing users' Quality of Service (QoS), which requires the learning process to be efficient, i.e., minimize its overhead. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off and propose a dynamic balancing strategy between the learning and data planes, which allows the centralized learning agent to quickly converge to an efficient resource allocation strategy, while minimizing the impact on QoS. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms static allocation methods, converging to the optimal policy (i.e., maximum efficacy and minimum overhead of the learning plane) in the long run.",1938-1883,978-1-5386-7462-8,10.1109/ICC45041.2023.10279135,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10279135,Resource allocation;Reinforcement learning;Cost of learning;Edge networking;Network slicing,Deep learning;Costs;Simulation;Friction;Quality of service;Reinforcement learning;Dynamic scheduling,,1.0,,12.0,IEEE,23 Oct 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, traditional UAV monitoring systems rely on direct communication between the UAV and the ground pilot, which has several limitations such as limited range, poor reliability, and susceptibility to interference. To overcome these limitations, there has been significant interest in integrating UAVs into cellular networks such as 5G/6G network slicing. The flexibility of network slicing allows UAVs to operate on different slices based on their communication needs, which can improve their performance and efficiency. However, integrating UAVs into network slicing also poses several challenges, such as managing communication and permissions of UAVs and base stations, access control of UAVs, and identity management of UAVs. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain, Non-Fungible Token(NFT), Federated Learning(FL), and Zero-Trust(ZT) security-enabled UAV monitoring platform for 5G/6G network sliced environments. We propose a novel approach in which UAVs are represented as NFT tokens within the platform. This innovative representation allows for enhanced security and trust in the system, aligning with the principles of the Zero-Trust security model, which assumes no implicit trust in any network component or user. Furthermore, we propose a FL system that operates on top of the blockchain, which can analyze data from multiple UAVs across different network slices.

To support relevant use cases, including sensing, edge learning, and edge inference, all require transmission of high-dimensional data or AI models over the air. To overcome the bottleneck, we propose a novel framework of SEMantic DAta Sourcing (SEMDAS) for locating semantically matched data sources to efficiently enable edge-intelligence operations. The comprehensive framework comprises new architecture, protocol, semantic matching techniques, and design principles for task-oriented wireless techniques. As the key component of SEMDAS, we discuss a set of machine learning based semantic matching techniques targeting different edge-intelligence use cases. Moreover, for designing task-oriented wireless techniques, we discuss different trade-offs in SEMDAS systems, propose the new concept of joint semantics-and-channel matching, and point to a number of research opportunities.

Interference management techniques such as centralized power control can improve spectral efficiency in dense deployments of such subnetworks. However, existing solutions for centralized power control may require full channel state information (CSI) of all the desired and interfering links, which may be cumbersome and time-consuming to obtain in dense deployments. This paper presents a novel solution for centralized power control for industrial subnetworks based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The proposed method only requires the subnetwork positioning information, usually known at the central controller, and the knowledge of the desired link channel gain during the execution phase.

In other words, to ensure sustainability requirements, we need to rethink the design of every component of the 6G network: energy consumption in Wireless Links, energy consumption in Infrastructure, and energy consumption in Tx/Rx Hardware. Embedded Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an effective solution. It allows constrained hardware to run complex AI algorithms, avoiding energy-costly transmission processes. However, Embedded AI devices still need to offload some computation tasks, such as training, and current MTC communication protocols struggle to meet the requirements. Thus, we propose a new communication design based on embedded AI and computational offloading in Massive MTC communication. By using these two solutions, we show how future 6G networks could integrate green communication energy saving in both Tx/Rx hardware devices and Infrastructure.",,979-8-3503-0673-6,10.1109/6GNet58894.2023.10317778,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10317778,AI;TinyML;Computation offloading;green communication;LoRa,6G mobile communication;Wireless communication;Training;Energy consumption;Wireless sensor networks;5G mobile communication;Green products,,2.0,,17.0,IEEE,20 Nov 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Automated vehicles (AVs) should be able to detect their surroundings by evaluating a huge amount of data that has been collected by diverse onboard sensors close to the existent time domain. Accordingly, the AVs will incur significant computing costs while using the employed artificial intelligence (AI) technique to complete tasks, and the accuracy of inference cannot be guaranteed.

Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) mechanisms have been developed to enable deterministic features in standard Ethernet. 5G and 6G networks are looking forward to integrate TSN and benefit from its ability to ensure determinism. Accommodating the complexity of TSN networks in 6G is not straightforward. In particular, conventional rule-based heuristic algorithms are not optimized for such environments. Therefore, the TSN network management framework should be equipped with the right tools allowing to compute at runtime new TSN configuration for each event (e.g. change in topology, new application, new device, etc.). To address this problem, recent standardization initiatives (IETF and ITU-T) have investigated the opportunities to use Network Digital Twin (NDT) paradigm for these use cases of 6G networks.This paper proposes a framework that puts together the key enablers to support NDT deployment for TSN-based public or private 6G network and to cope with the relevant challenges. In particular, we define a modular and self-learner NDT framework. To construct the DT model, the framework can rely on open source simulators/emulators with predefined models, or in other cases, it may learn the DT model from real infrastructure using Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) techniques trained over collected data.

At mmWaves/sub-THz frequencies, MIMO channels exhibit few leading paths in the space-time (ST) domain (i.e., directions or arrival/departure and delays). Algebraic low-rank (LR) channel estimation exploits ST channel sparsity through the computation of position-dependent MIMO channel eigenmodes leveraging recurrent training vehicle passages in the coverage cell.

However, satisfying the demands of network slice requests is a challenging task. Energy-efficient, secure, and Quality of Service (QoS) aware network slicing is important since network slices must share fewer amounts of resources. Further, implementing secure network slicing for software-defined networks (SDNs)/network function virtualization (NFV) is crucial. In this article, we tackle the issues, such as security, QoS, and resource consumption issues through network slicing and load balancing mechanisms in SDN/NFV assisted 6G environments. First, deep network slicing is implemented using generative adversarial network (GAN) for network slicing and management. Based on the slice capacity, slice priority, and QoS demands of network slices, GAN predicts the appropriate slice and links for data transmission. For each slice, the directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based blockchain technology is used in which traditional consensus is replaced by the Proof of Space (PoS) algorithm. A limitation of scalability and high resource consumption in the traditional blockchain is addressed in DAG-blockchain.

However, several challenges prohibit the realization of the full potential of VLC, namely, limited modulation bandwidth, ambient light interference, optical diffuse reflection effects, devices' nonlinearity, and random receiver orientation. On the contrary, centralized machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated significant potential in handling different challenges related to wireless communication systems. Specifically, it has been shown that ML algorithms exhibit superior capabilities in handling complicated network tasks, such as channel equalization, estimation and modeling, resources allocation, and opportunistic spectrum access control, to name a few. Nevertheless, concerns pertaining to privacy and communication overhead when sharing raw data of the involved clients with a server constitute major bottlenecks in the implementation of centralized ML techniques. This has led to the emergence of a new distributed ML paradigm, namely federated learning (FL), which can reduce the cost associated with transferring raw data, and preserve privacy by training ML models locally and collaboratively at the clients' side. Hence, it becomes evident that integrating FL into VLC networks can provide ubiquitous and reliable implementation of VLC systems. With this motivation, this is the first in-depth review in the literature on the application of FL in VLC networks.

However, massive vehicles and unstable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links may become bottlenecks for the low-latency delivery of contents, such as safety-critical emergency messages and multimedia. Instead of resolving the problem in a centralized way, we propose a massive vehicular Internet-of-Things system and investigate the approach that would enable each vehicle to decide the transmission mode from three modes, i.e., vehicle-to-network, vehicle-to-infrastructure and V2V sidelinks, and wireless resources. Specifically, a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework is formulated by combining the multiagent RL approach, WoLF-PHC, with the techniques from deep  $Q$ -learning (DQN) to gain the formulated framework with the capability of capturing the effects of interaction between learning agents and states of complex environment.

Traditionally, most service provisioning techniques considered security metrics separately from the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Expectation (QoE) parameters. The QoS/QoE parameters include data throughput, experienced delay, tolerable latency, jitter, resource utilization rate, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, fairness, and other emerging key performance indicators (KPIs). Also, there are various security attributes, such as encryption key strength, authentication strength, network anomaly score, privacy metric, and so on. Typically, the resource allocation optimization techniques to maximize the security aspects to protect the communication of mobile users or user equipment (UEs) have an adverse effect on the service quality. Therefore, a key research gap exists in balancing service quality and security levels in communication networks that has been either overlooked or identified in a rather scattered manner by researchers in the recent decade. Thus, a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art to clearly address this research gap and outline the possible solutions is yet to appear in the existing literature. In this paper, we address this by surveying the existing practices, challenges, and opportunities in the emerging 6G (i.e., beyond 5G) networks, where various AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based techniques such as deep learning meet the classical optimization techniques, to balance the service performance and security levels. Several networking topologies with relevant use-cases are included in the survey to discuss the existing and emerging trends of isolated as well as joint treatment of service and security levels.

A key task, for which recent works have advocated the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), is tracking the tenant demand and scaling its resources. Nevertheless, for edge resources (e.g. RAN), a question arises whether operators can: (a) scale edge resources fast enough (often in the order of ms) and (b) afford to transmit huge amounts of data towards a cloud where such a DNN-based algorithm might operate. We propose a Distributed-DNN architecture for a class of such problems: a small subset of the DNN layers at the edge attempt to act as fast, standalone resource allocator; this is coupled with a Bayesian mechanism to intelligently offload a subset of (harder) decisions to additional DNN layers running at a remote cloud.

The rising and inevitable off-loading requirements of IoE devices have resulted in an unprecedented increase in the reliance on edge and cloud paradigms. However, such a reliance on far-end technologies to access already scarce resources can often result in increased latency and unstable connection issues due to limited bandwidth. In this paper, we investigate the solution for such a stringent network design by presenting a conceptual cloud architecture based on key components such as resource allocation, scheduling and task off-loading for IoE devices. The IoE devices utilise a scheduler to access resources from nearby higher resourced IoE devices for their task computation, where the scheduler allocates incoming requests according to the availability of resources within a cluster of devices or to other devices in nearby clusters. Motivated by these design characteristics, we propose a design of a novel Main Task Off-loading Scheduling Algorithm (MTOSA) for efficient task allocation and dissemination. We present a theoretical analysis of five different scheduling policies namely Round Robin (RR), Strongest Channel (SC), Max Rate (MR), Proportional Fair (PF) and Priority Base (PB) scheduling to find an optimal technique for task off-loading in futuristic networks.

Featuring with the explosively increasing multimedia-traffics with very diverse services requirements, the 6G mobile wireless networks need to provide the customized services with heterogeneous types of quality of service (QoS) guarantees. However, how to efficiently support these customized services with heterogeneous QoS provisioning for 6G wireless networks has imposed many new challenges not encountered before.

Specifically, we develop the AI-enabled network architectural schemes which efficiently integrate three 6G-candidate techniques - massive-MIMO, NFV, and SDN - to significantly improve key performances of heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning in terms of effective capacity. We apply the massive MIMO transmission to substantially improve the channel throughput. Our NFV-based schemes abstract and slice the physical infrastructure and wireless resources in network data plane into several virtualized networks and obtain the optimal service delivery path with the maximum effective capacity among virtualized networks. Also, we develop a set of AI-enabled techniques including multiagent AI-plane architectures, edge-Al frameworks, and federated learning mechanisms for efficiently implementing our developed massive-MIMO-NFV-SDN integrated schemes. Collaborating with our developed platform and techniques, our multi-agent AI-plane based SDN controller coordinates the network nodes and resources allocations for each virtualized network.

However, the system performance of ABS-assisted networks is severely confined by the limited endurance of the on-board battery. To overcome this energy issue, we are exploring the robotic airborne base station (RABS) with energy neutral grasping end-effectors able to autonomously perch at tall urban landforms. This paper studies the optimal deployment (fly to another grasping location or remain in the same one) and operation (active or sleep mode at an epoch) of RABS based on the spatio-temporal distribution of underlying traffic load, which problem is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) aiming to maximize the volume of served traffic load under the on-board energy constraints. To tackle the curse of dimensionality in this ILP formulation, we first investigate a special case with a single RABS in the system and develop a Lagrangian heuristic algorithm to solve it by exploiting the totally unimodularity structure. A polynomial-time method is then proposed to decompose the multi-RABS problem into several single-RABS cases based on the Hungarian algorithm. In terms of aggregated traffic that can be supported, numerical results reveal that a single RABS outperforms four (4) fixed micro cells when the serving duration ranges from 10 to 24 hours, allowing in that sense efficient network densification. The traffic loaded in a RABS is 3.2 times higher than a fixed small cell when the traffic distribution is highly heterogeneous.

Research has gained momentum over the past few years to study the gains of RIS and the optimal configuration of its elements. This paper is concerned with the optimal configuration of RIS elements; we consider a single base station (BS) serving multiple single-antenna users and formulate the problem of minimizing the total transmit power while jointly optimizing the allocated power to users and the RIS phase shifts. In line with the existing literature, the problem is decomposed into power control and RIS phase shift sub-problems. The power control sub-problem is the conventional power problem which is solved optimally through closed-form expression. Then, we tackle the problem of RIS passive beamforming optimization and propose two solutions leveraging a linear transformation and element-wise Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT), respectively. The main idea of the linear transformation approach is to reduce the number of optimization variables to the number of users associated with the RIS from the number of its elements which is, in general, very large. On the other hand, the main idea of the element-wise KKT-based approach is to obtain a closed-form expression for the RIS phase shifts for a multi-user scenario, similar to the single-user case. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes have performance in total transmitted power close to the numerical solution and have much lower computational complexity than the baseline solutions. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed solutions have a competitive performance in terms of optimality and complexity for large-scale RIS.

In this paper, we introduce an interdisciplinary approach linking the concepts of e-healthcare, priority, big data analytics (BDA) and radio resource optimization in a multi-tier 5G network. We employ three machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, naïve Bayesian (NB) classifier, logistic regression (LR), and decision tree (DT), working as an ensemble system to analyze historical medical records of stroke out-patients (OPs) and readings from body-attached internet-of-things (IoT) sensors to predict the likelihood of an imminent stroke. We convert the stroke likelihood into a risk factor functioning as a priority in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Hence, the task is to optimally allocate physical resource blocks (PRBs) to HetNet users while prioritizing OPs by granting them high gain PRBs according to the severity of their medical state. Thus, empowering the OPs to send their critical data to their healthcare provider with minimized delay. To that end, two optimization approaches are proposed, a weighted sum rate maximization (WSRMax) approach and a proportional fairness (PF) approach. The proposed approaches increased the OPs' average signal to interference plus noise (SINR) by 57% and 95%, respectively. The WSRMax approach increased the system's total SINR to a level higher than that of the PF approach, nevertheless, the PF approach yielded higher SINRs for the OPs, better fairness and a lower margin of error.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992555,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); INTERNET(grant numbers:EP/H040536/1); STAR Projects(grant numbers:EP/K016873/1); TOWS Projects(grant numbers:EP/S016570/1); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086596,HetNet uplink optimization;MILP;machine learning;patient-centric;network optimization;naïve Bayesian classifier;decision tree;logistic regression;ensemble;6G;resource allocation;spectrum allocation;big data analytics,Optimization;Machine learning;Big Data;Stroke (medical condition);Resource management;Support vector machines;Interference,,42.0,,65.0,CCBY,5 May 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The scheduling is influenced by the diverse intents of different parties, including the time-sensitive nature of device-generated tasks and the energy efficiency of servers. The complexity of this problem under dynamic network conditions is underscored by its nature as a Markov state transition process, typically classified as NP-hard. We introduce an intent-driven intelligent task scheduling approach (IITSA), which models a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and introduces a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) method. We introduce a dynamic adaptive mechanism to effectively address conflicts arising from the temporal requirements and energy limitations associated with various tasks on MEC servers.

This offers numerous advantages for next-generation networks including ultra-high-speed wireless communication, location-based multiple access (LDMA), efficient wireless power transfer (WPT), interference mitigation, and improved information security. SBF necessitates ELPMs with precise channel state information (CSI) for all ELPM elements.

Moreover, in wireless topologies characterized by fast varying channels, timely and accurate CSI acquisition might not be possible and the transmitters (CSIT) only have statistical CSI available. This work focuses on the appropriate selection of relaying mode in a cooperative network, comprising a single information source, one buffer-aided (BA) relay with full-duplex (FD) capabilities, and a single destination. Here, prior to each transmission, the relay should select to operate either in FD mode with power control, or, resort to half-duplex (HD) relaying when excessive self-interference (SI) arises.

To fully exploit the benefits of such a distributed architecture, there needs to be a paradigm shift from centralized to distributed management. To enable distributed management, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising choice, due to its ability to learn dynamic changes in environments and to deal with complex problems. However, the deployment of highly distributed RL – termed massive distribution of intelligence – still faces a few unsolved challenges. Existing RL solutions, based on Q-Learning (QL) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) do not scale with the number of agents. Therefore, current limitations, i.e., convergence, system performance and training stability, need to be addressed, to facilitate a practical deployment of massive distribution. To this end, we propose improved Double Deep Q-Network (IDDQN), addressing the long-term stability of the agents’ training behavior. We evaluate the effectiveness of IDDQN for a beyond 5G/6G use case: auto-scaling virtual resources in a network slice. Simulation results show that IDDQN improves the training stability over DQN and converges at least 2 times sooner than QL. In terms of the number of users served by a slice, IDDQN shows good performance and only deviates on average 8% from the optimal solution. Further, IDDQN is robust and resource-efficient after convergence. We argue that IDDQN is a better alternative than QL and DQN, and holds immense potential for efficiently managing 6G networks.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2023.3333875,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10323293,6G;network management;network automation;reinforcement learning;machine learning;distributed intelligence;model training stability;scalability,6G mobile communication;Convergence;Training;Scalability;5G mobile communication;Benchmark testing;Behavioral sciences,,2.0,,54.0,IEEE,20 Nov 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

We consider a scenario of dense deployment of subnetworks in the factory environment. The limited number of sub-bands must be optimally allocated to coordinate inter-subnetwork interference. Traditional iterative solutions may not scale to the large scale and density of sub-network deployment due to their execution overhead limitations. Hence, we consider a data-driven approach based on graph neural networks. We model the subnetwork deployment as an interference graph and propose an unsupervised learning approach to optimize the sub-band allocation using graph neural networks. This approach is inspired by the graph colouring heuristic and the Potts model. The numerical evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves close performance to the centralized greedy colouring sub-band allocation heuristic with lower computational time complexity. In addition, it incurs reduced signalling overhead compared to iterative optimization heuristics that require all the mutual interfering channel information.

While some slices tolerate the delay and some do not, this versatility of slice services imposes challenges to Mobile Network Operators in designing a robust, scalable, and yet resilient 5GC. Therefore, in this work, we build a self-resilient 5GC that not only addresses the scheduling requirements per slice type but also yields service satisfaction. Precisely, we build it as a combination of large Integer Linear Programming based Column Generation (CG) and Artificial Intelligence based Deep Learning in a Closed Loop Automation with a Self Organizing Network paradigm.

However, another 6G core property of high-precision positioning can hardly be supported by existing 6G DT solutions due to the lack of environmental modelling and signal interactions with physical scenes. This shortcoming yields a series of challenges in 6G DT-enabled positioning, including positioning data acquisition, accuracy enhancement, and continuous optimization. In this regard, we propose a novel paradigm of localization-oriented DT (LocDT) with a compound architecture of 7 sub-DT layers to characterize the 6G integrated-localization-and-communication (ILAC) feature. LocDT starts from a physical environment sublayer to mirror 6G signal interactions within a real-world scenario, along with an ILAC baseband sublayer and a channel frequency Polar-coordinate (CFP) image construction method to provide finer-grained fingerprints. Furthermore, insight from LocDT reveals an interesting phenomenon: the channel features of Line-of-Sight (LoS) / None-Los (NLoS) gNodeBs make differentiated-contributions to positioning accuracy, especially in wide-existing partial-LoS-coverage scenarios. Benefiting from this, a DT-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) positioning model, SSI-Net, is designed with a device-attention mechanism, achieving complementary improvements in accuracy.

Channel measurements cannot cover all scenarios and frequency bands for 6G, and conventional models lack accurate predictive capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel 6G space-time joint predictive channel model to predict channels in the space-time domains, which can rebuild lost measurement data and correct abnormal data. The proposed model designs a space-time generative adversarial network (STGAN) framework, conditioned on channel large-scale and small-scale characteristics, to synthesize sufficient space-time channel datasets, effectively overcoming data shortages. Accompanied by path identification and characteristic classification, the coupled gated recurrent unit (GRU) framework conducts precise predictions for unknown channels in the space-time domains. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed model's superiority over other methods, including the geometry-based stochastic channel model (GBSM), GRU, long short-term memory (LSTM), and radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN).

In this article, we provide a vision for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks and an overview of how signal processing, optimization, and machine learning (ML) techniques can be leveraged to make them a reality in the context of 6G.

To improve efficiency, maritime sector activities are focused on the realization of Smart Shipping (SMS), leveraging 6G Communications, Energy Efficiency (EE) and Machine Learning (ML). However, conventional Centralized Machine Learning (CML) cannot be easily applied in the maritime, mainly due to the drawbacks: (i) prohibitive data communication overhead and bandwidth limitations, since CML requires centralization of massive data through transmissions from heterogeneous sources, (ii) excessive energy consumption associated with massive data transfers, (iii) remarkable transmission errors due to harsh propagation conditions, and (iv) data privacy violation, since the data carries sensitive and commercial information. This article proposes a two-fold Federated Learning (FL) scheme (FedShip) to improve the privacy, EE and communication-efficiency of future 6G maritime networks. FedShip uses the Over-the-Air computation (AirComp) principles to exploit the signal superposition property and ensure that local models are accurately and efficiently combined. Using real data regarding the fuel consumption of multiple cargo ships, we compared the FL performance, building multiple timeseries forecasting models, with collaborative ML baselines. AirComp performance was also assessed using simulation data about channel measurements. After optimizing the hyperparameters of the local models, extensive results revealed that: (i) FL shows enhanced fuel prediction accuracy (95.5% relative to the CML), while ensuring data privacy and (ii) AirComp can be adopted to combine the local models with low computation error, offering significant EE and spectrum efficiency improvements, especially when dense 6G scenarios are considered.",1558-0016,,10.1109/TITS.2024.3468383,“Trustworthy and Resilient Decentralized Intelligence for Edge Systems ” Project(grant numbers:101093006); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707001,6G communications;federated learning;internet of ships;Internet of Things;machine learning;maritime communications;over-the-air computation;smart shipping,Training;Marine vehicles;Biological system modeling;Data models;Fuels;Accuracy;Data privacy;Atmospheric modeling;6G mobile communication;Energy efficiency,,,,53.0,IEEE,7 Oct 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Recently, UAVs have been used as flying relays to support terrestrial cellular networks for enhancing coverage and connectivity. Multiple UAVs serve as data collectors at a common altitude in a UAV-aided Internet of Things (IoT) network. Data collected is processed by Federated Learning (FL) before being sent to central servers to protect users’ privacy and reduce communication costs. Batteries in UAVs are tiny and efficient only for a short duration, making FL challenging to execute for many iterations. Therefore, a Multi-UAV Energy Efficient Coverage Deployment algorithm based on a Spatial Adaptive Play (MUECD-SAP) is proposed in this article. MUECD uses a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize the accurate location of deployed UAVs based on the Signal-toInterference Ratio (SINR) to increase the data collection rate. Also, to make the FL run for multiple iterations, SAP dynamically allocates resources using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to optimize the energy consumed and the link latency between the user and the UAV system. The proposed MUECD algorithm outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms by achieving an improved data rate and balanced SINR value. The proposed SAP resource allocation strategy has improved the FL execution by 66.67% and attains a very low latency and energy consumed compared to other resource allocation techniques.",1939-9359,,10.1109/TVT.2024.3390226,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10504793,Unmanned Aerial Vehicles;Coverage Optimization;Resource Allocation;Internet of Things;Federated Learning;Deep Reinforcement Learning,Autonomous aerial vehicles;Internet of Things;Resource management;6G mobile communication;Data collection;Signal to noise ratio;Servers,,,,,IEEE,17 Apr 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles

However, the opaque nature of complex deep learning (DL) models lacks explainability and robustness, posing a significant hindrance to adoption in practice. Furthermore, wireless communication experts and stakeholders, concerned about potential vulnerabilities, such as data privacy issues or biased decision-making, express reluctance to fully embrace these AI technologies. To this end, this article sheds light on the importance and means of achieving explainability and robustness toward trustworthy AI-based RRM solutions for 6G networks. We outline a range of explainable and robust AI techniques for feature visualization and attribution; model simplification and interpretability; model compression; and sensitivity analysis, then explain how they can be leveraged for RRM. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the application of explainability and robustness in wireless network design. The former case focuses on exploiting explainable AI methods to simplify the model by reducing the input size of deep reinforcement learning agents for scalable RRM of vehicular networks. On the other hand, the latter case highlights the importance of providing interpretable explanations of credible and confident decisions of a DL-based beam alignment solution in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems.

Such a context urges a heavy usage of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, particularly Deep Learning (DL), to foster innovation and ease the deployment of intelligent network functions/operations, which are able to fulfill the various requirements of the envisioned 6G services. The revolution of 6G networks is driven by massive data availability, moving from centralized and big data towards small and distributed data. This trend has motivated the adoption of distributed and collaborative ML/DL techniques. Specifically, collaborative ML/DL consists of deploying a set of distributed agents that collaboratively train learning models without sharing their data, thus improving data privacy and reducing the time/communication overhead. This work provides a comprehensive study on how collaborative learning can be effectively deployed over 6G wireless networks. In particular, our study focuses on Split Federated Learning (SFL), a technique that recently emerged promising better performance compared with existing collaborative learning approaches.

Traditional protocol standardization is a cumbersome task that yields hardcoded predefined protocols, resulting in increased costs and delayed rollout. Going beyond these limitations, this article proposes a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) communication framework called standalone explainable protocol (STEP) for future sixth-generation (6G) open radio access network (O-RAN) slicing. As new conditions arise and affect network operation, resource orchestration agents adapt their communication messages to promote the emergence of a protocol on-the-fly, which enables the mitigation of conflict and resource contention between network slices. STEP weaves together the notion of information bottleneck (IB) theory with deep Q-network (DQN) learning concepts. By incorporating a stochastic bottleneck layer - inspired by variational autoencoders (VAEs) - STEP imposes an information-theoretic constraint for emergent inter-agent communication. This ensures that agents exchange concise and meaningful information, preventing resource waste and enhancing the overall system performance. The learned protocols enhance interpretability, laying a robust foundation for standardizing next-generation 6G networks. By considering an O-RAN compliant network slicing resource allocation problem, a conflict resolution protocol is developed. In particular, the results demonstrate that, on average, STEP reduces inter-slice conflicts by up to 6.06× compared to a predefined protocol method. Furthermore, in comparison with an MADRL baseline, STEP achieves 1.4× and 3.5× lower resource underutilization and latency, respectively.",1558-0687,,10.1109/MWC.015.2300552,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10702574,,6G mobile communication;Protocols;Network slicing;System performance;Prevention and mitigation;Open RAN;Standardization;Resource management;Next generation networking;Information theory,,3.0,,15.0,IEEE,2 Oct 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Magazines

However, a RIS-assisted communication system typically involves cascaded channels with intricate large-scale data distribution. Hence, practical implementation of the optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator may be infeasible due to its excessive complexity. In addition, most of the existing artificial intelligence (AI)-based channel estimation methods generally rely on convolutional neural networks, which only guarantee the estimation accuracy without considering the estimation time. To address these problems, an efficient parallel Transformer (EPformer) is proposed to achieve efficient channel estimation by jointly considering both estimation accuracy and estimation time. Firstly, the channel estimation problem is formulated as a parallel super-resolution (PSR) problem, given that the elements on the RIS are typically distributed in a two-dimensional manner. Then, the multi-head attention mechanism is employed to extract the deep channel features from the input data in parallel. To further enhance the estimation accuracy, the super-resolution block (SRB) is designed to denoise the noisy channel matrices.

Among them, mmWave spectrum exploitation stands out for its ability to deliver ultra-high data rates. However, its full adoption beyond fifth generation multicast systems (5G+/6G) remains hampered, mainly due to mobility robustness issues. In this work, we propose a solution to address the problem of efficient sidelink-assisted multicasting in mobile multimode systems, specifically by considering the possibility of jointly utilizing sidelink/device-to-device (D2D), unicast, and multicast transmissions to improve service delivery. To overcome the complexity problem in finding the optimal solution for user-mode binding, we introduce a pre-optimization step called multicast group formation (MGF). Through a clustering technique based on unsupervised machine learning, MGF allows to reduce the complexity of solving the sidelink-assisted multiple modes mmWave (SA3M) problem. A detailed analysis of the impact of various system parameters on performance is conducted, and numerical evidence of the complexity/performance trade-off and its dependence on mobility patterns and user distribution is provided.

Network slice mobility (NSM), which considers user mobility, service migration, and resource allocation from a holistic view, is witnessed as a key technology in enabling network slices to respond quickly to service degradation. Existing studies on NSM either ignored the trigger detection before NSM decision-making or didn't consider the prediction of future system information to improve the NSM performance, and the training of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents also faces challenges with incomplete observations. To cope with these challenges, we consider that network slices migrate periodically and utilize the prediction of system information to assist NSM decision-making. The periodical NSM problem is further transformed into a Markov decision process, and we creatively propose a prediction-based federated DRL framework to solve it.

This paper proposes a novel graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework named TANGO which relies on a symbolic subsystem.

The proposed solution includes artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge of the network and applies two control-level loops to obtain optimal performance compared to other techniques. The ORAN facilitates programmable network architectures to support such multi-time scale management using AI approaches. The proposed algorithms analyze the maximum utilization of resources from slice performance to take decisions at the inter-slice level. Inter-slice intelligent agents work at a non-real-time level to reconfigure resources within various slices. Further than meeting the slice requirements, the intra-slice objective must also include the minimization of maximum resource utilization. This enables smart utilization of the resources within each slice without affecting slice performance. Here, each xApp that is an intra-slice agent aims at meeting the optimal quality of service (QoS) of the users, but at the same time, some inter-slice objectives should be included to coordinate intra- and inter-slice agents. This is done without penalizing the main intra-slice objective. All intelligent agents use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to meet their objectives.

However, ensuring the trustworthiness of AI black-boxes in real deployments is challenging. Explainable AI (XAI) tools can play a vital role in establishing transparency among the stakeholders in the slicing ecosystem. But there is a trade-off between AI performance and explainability, posing a dilemma for trustworthy 6G network slicing because the stakeholders require both highly performing AI models for efficient resource allocation and explainable decision-making to ensure fairness, accountability, and compliance. To balance this trade off and inspired by the closed loop automation and XAI methodologies, this paper presents a novel explanation-guided in-hoc federated learning (FL) approach where a constrained resource allocation model and an explainer exchange—in a closed loop (CL) fashion—soft attributions of the features as well as inference predictions to achieve a transparent 6G network slicing resource management in a RAN-Edge setup under non-independent identically distributed (non-IID) datasets.

To solve this complex problem, we focus on the distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method for proactive caching, including content prediction and content decision-making. Specifically, since the prior information of user requests is seldom available practically in the current time period, a novel method named temporal convolution sequence network (TCSN) based on the temporal convolution network (TCN) and attention model is used to improve the accuracy of content prediction. Furthermore, according to the value of content prediction, the distributional deep Q network (DDQN) seeks to build a distribution model on returns to optimize the policy of content decision-making. The generative adversarial network (GAN) is adapted in a distributed fashion, emphasizing learning the data distribution and generating compelling data across multiple nodes. In addition, the prioritized experience replay (PER) is helpful to learn from the most effective sample. So we propose a multivariate fusion algorithm called PG-DDQN.

Also, 6G promises to provide better throughput, higher data rates and lower latency than existing technology. By utilizing the offerings of 6G, UAV traffic management (UTM) system is envisioned which covers the aerial as well as ground vehicles. Because of many incidents on the road such as accidents, blockade, traffic jam, proper monitoring is essential but present traffic management systems lack in many aspects due to its static nature. A subset of UTM is the road traffic management (RTM) system that solely focuses on maintaining an optimized and efficient traffic flow of the land vehicles. Proper integration of UAVs with the 6G terrestrial infrastructure and technologies such as digital twin, massive MIMO, artificial intelligence, block chain etc. will lead to a dynamic RTM system. This paper provides an overview of the UAV-RTM system in the presence of 6G technology. In order to do that, a review of the UAV-RTM process and the integration of space and ground devices are presented.

To accomplish these goals, in this article, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based holographic MIMO (HMIMO)-empowered cell-free (CF) network is proposed while leveraging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). The proposed AI-based framework allocates the desired power for beamforming by activating the required number of grids from the serving HMIMO base stations (BSs) in the CF network to serve the users. An optimization problem is formulated that maximizes the sensing utility function, which in turn maximizes the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the received signal, the sensing SINR of the reflected echo signal, and EE, ensuring efficient power allocation. To solve the optimization problem, an AI-based framework is proposed to enable a decomposition of the NP-hard problem into two subproblems: 1) a sensing subproblem and 2) a power allocation subproblem. Initially, a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based scheme is utilized to solve the sensing subproblem that identifies the current location of the users with the sensing information. Then, a transformer-based mechanism is devised to allocate the desired power to users by activating the required grids from the serving HMIMO BSs in the CF network based on the sensing information achieved with the VAE-based scheme.

However, a key challenge lies in the transmission at Terahertz frequencies, which entails significant signal loss, resulting in reduced signal-to-interference and noise ratio margins ( $\Gamma $ ). Increased transmit power can ameliorate  $\Gamma $  and SE, thereby sacrificing EE. Consequently, it necessitates strategic Resource Allocation (RA) to uphold an optimal trade-off amid SE, EE and  $\Gamma $ . In this paper, we propose a series of RA strategic algorithms harnessing the Transfer Learning, Growth-Share (GS) matrix, Game Theory (GT), and service priorities to tailor the aforementioned trade-off.

Furthermore, we have seamlessly integrated Device-to-Device communication scenarios into our proposed algorithms, enhancing SE and network capacity.

However, the existing DRL-based method faces the problem of repeated model training and poor generalization ability when service demand fluctuates and environmental changes occur.

We further propose a collective reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithm that facilitates knowledge collaboration between the agents through the policy distribution. Simulation results verify that the proposed GAT-CRL achieves fast convergence as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) in 4K steps, computing the similarity score more accurately with the increasing attention heads, and achieves higher successful flow than the soft actor-critic (about 3.6%–5.4%) and DDPG (about 14.6%–21%) when adapting to unseen traffic patterns/loads and increasing topology scales.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2024.3416054,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902080,61972104,62002072,61702120); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1804403,2018YFB1802200); Special Projects in Key Areas of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B010118001); Science and Technology Project in Guangzhou(grant numbers:201803010081); Foshan Science and Technology Innovation Project, China(grant numbers:2018IT100283); Guangzhou Key Laboratory(grant numbers:202102100006); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China(grant numbers:202002020035); Research Projects in Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021ZDJS026); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10560516,Collective reinforcement learning (CRL);graph attention (GAT);knowledge collaboration;resource allocation,Training;Collaboration;6G mobile communication;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Servers;Computational modeling,,,,50.0,IEEE,18 Jun 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

With the development of distributed energy, higher requirements are being placed on the communication resource scheduling capabilities of virtual power plants. For dense source-load-storage devices, the high bandwidth, low latency, and high energy efficiency characteristics of 6G networks can meet the control requirements of virtual power plants for these devices. Digital twins are currently widely used in the industrial sector, providing positive effects such as real-time monitoring, prediction, and performance optimization. Applying digital twins to the communication resource scheduling of virtual power plants enables real-time perception of resource allocation and timely resource scheduling. This paper proposes a communication resource scheduling algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, leveraging digital twin technology and the 6G distributed subnet architecture. This algorithm aims to efficiently utilize limited resources such as resource blocks, spectrum, and power to balance system throughput, fairness, and scheduling latency, thereby ensuring the QoS of source-load-storage device scheduling tasks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed resource scheduling algorithm enhances system throughput and fairness while meeting scheduling latency requirements, thereby satisfying the QoS needs of scheduling tasks.",2474-9141,979-8-3503-7767-5,10.1109/ICCCWorkshops62562.2024.10693737,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10693737,virtual power plants;Digital Twin;channel resource scheduling;power allocation;6G;deep reinforcement learning,6G mobile communication;Job shop scheduling;Scheduling algorithms;Computational modeling;Quality of service;Virtual power plants;Throughput;Real-time systems;Digital twins;Resource management,,,,17.0,IEEE,4 Oct 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
