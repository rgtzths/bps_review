Digital twin (DT) provides an alternative approach to proactively make real-time resource allocation by mapping and learning the complex network topology. However, the dual challenges of limited energy capacity and insufficient computing power of unmanned aerial vehicles make it difficult to establish digital twin on aerial networks. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a lightweight DT empowered air-ground network architecture, where the DT modelling task is distributed to diverse ground devices based on federated learning. To improve the efficiency of DT modelling, we design a distributed incentive mechanism that incentivizes high-performance ground devices to take part in federated learning. Considering the computing burden and possible private disclosure caused by the incentive, we further solve the incentive scheme with a new distributed algorithm. The optimal solution, such as the local training rounds and required accuracy of terminal devices, could be calculated in parallel on ground devices.

Network slicing is the key technology to deliver such customizable services. Slices and their dedicated resources should be provisioned optimally where the services will be run with low network latencies and associated expenses. However, the user dynamics on resource demands within and between slices result in different resource re-allocation triggers, ultimately lead to distinct mobility patterns, e.g., scaling, migration, where sufficient resources must be transferred. Efficient slice mobility requires increasing flexibility in network operation and management to ensure the customized QoS while minimizing the corresponding mobility cost. In this paper, a prediction-based intelligent network analytic is proposed to facilitate the optimized network slice mobility scheme. We will investigate how to utilize the user and network prediction as the auxiliary information to make the slice mobility decision with the objective of maximizing the long-term profits while minimizing the latency and mobility cost. Finally, we evaluate the proposed prediction-based network slice mobility scheme in a simulated environment and compare its performance in terms of system costs, revenues, and profits with two benchmark solutions.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-7462-8","10.1109/ICC45041.2023.10279739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10279739","","6G mobile communication;Performance evaluation;Intelligent networks;Costs;Network slicing;Quality of service;Benchmark testing","","4","","15","IEEE","23 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

O-RAN networks are to be implemented as multi-vendor systems with interoperable components and can be programmatically optimized through centralized abstraction layer and data driven closed-loop control.

The Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm is a prominent solution that allows devices to offload intensive tasks and allocate resources. However, the terrestrial MEC servers will be overwhelmed and unable to meet the requirements of 6G technologies for ultra-low-latency applications and mobile devices. Aerial-borne MEC servers have recently supported ultra-reliable, low-latency communication applications and mobile devices in an emergency scenario by providing resources and relaying them to a cloud server.

To tackle resource wastage and power efficiency of 6G-enabled devices, we present an AI-based solution that utilizes pre-trained Deep Learning (DL) models to classify Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulated Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) signals.

Solutions like software-defined networking (SDN), and network function virtualization (NFV) are proposed with 6G, but the core management operations are still manual. Thus, to automatically upscale these 6G-IoT networks at reduced cost orchestration complexity, zero-touch networks (ZTN) are proposed. ZTN in 6G-IoT allows a high degree of automation and seamless integration of services. The article proposes a scheme, Zero-Load, that integrates ZTN at the core routing functionality of the 6G-IoT applications. We present a load balancing and traffic classification scheme through the ZTN networking stack for core routers. The ZTN router configuration fabric connects applications with the core services. Further, we present a Gaussian kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) classifier at the ZTN automation layer, which classifies the normal traffic and attack traffic. The proposed work is compared for parameters like mean time to response (MTTR), and resolution latency against baseline SDN and NFV schemes. Using ZTN, an average improvement of 32.45% is obtained in MTTR, and 87.89% in resolution latency (against a query). Using the Gaussian RBF kernel, an accuracy of 0.9914 is reported. These results indicate that ZTN-based management paves the way toward a more dense and intelligent 6G-IoT network.","","979-8-3503-2138-8","10.1109/ECAI58194.2023.10194090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10194090","6G;Zero Touch Networks;Internet-of-Things;Network Management;Network Functions","6G mobile communication;Support vector machines;Protocols;Routing;Load management;Network function virtualization;Time factors","","3","","20","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Featuring with the explosively increasing multimedia-traffics with very diverse services requirements, the 6G mobile wireless networks need to provide the customized services with heterogeneous types of quality of service (QoS) guarantees. However, how to efficiently support these customized services with heterogeneous QoS provisioning for 6G wireless networks has imposed many new challenges not encountered before. To conquer these difficulties, in this article we propose the artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled integration of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (massive-MIMO) techniques with network functions virtualization (NFV) and software-defined network (SDN) architectures to support the customized services over the 6G mobile wireless networks. Specifically, we develop the AI-enabled network architectural schemes which efficiently integrate three 6G-candidate techniques - massive-MIMO, NFV, and SDN - to significantly improve key performances of heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning in terms of effective capacity. We apply the massive MIMO transmission to substantially improve the channel throughput. Our NFV-based schemes abstract and slice the physical infrastructure and wireless resources in network data plane into several virtualized networks and obtain the optimal service delivery path with the maximum effective capacity among virtualized networks. Also, we develop a set of AI-enabled techniques including multiagent AI-plane architectures, edge-Al frameworks, and federated learning mechanisms for efficiently implementing our developed massive-MIMO-NFV-SDN integrated schemes. Collaborating with our developed platform and techniques, our multi-agent AI-plane based SDN controller coordinates the network nodes and resources allocations for each virtualized network. Our conducted extensive simulations validate and evaluate our developed massive-MIMO-NFV-SDN integrated architectures using AI-techniques, showing that they can efficiently support the customized statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning over 6G mobile wireless networks.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.005.2200408","U.S. Air Force(grant numbers:FA9453-15-C-0423); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10239348","","6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Wireless networks;Quality of service;Massive MIMO;Throughput;Network function virtualization;Artificial intelligence;Software defined networking","","4","","15","IEEE","5 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, the system performance of ABS-assisted networks is severely confined by the limited endurance of the on-board battery. To overcome this energy issue, we are exploring the robotic airborne base station (RABS) with energy neutral grasping end-effectors able to autonomously perch at tall urban landforms. This paper studies the optimal deployment (fly to another grasping location or remain in the same one) and operation (active or sleep mode at an epoch) of RABS based on the spatio-temporal distribution of underlying traffic load, which problem is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) aiming to maximize the volume of served traffic load under the on-board energy constraints. To tackle the curse of dimensionality in this ILP formulation, we first investigate a special case with a single RABS in the system and develop a Lagrangian heuristic algorithm to solve it by exploiting the totally unimodularity structure. A polynomial-time method is then proposed to decompose the multi-RABS problem into several single-RABS cases based on the Hungarian algorithm. In terms of aggregated traffic that can be supported, numerical results reveal that a single RABS outperforms four (4) fixed micro cells when the serving duration ranges from 10 to 24 hours, allowing in that sense efficient network densification. The traffic loaded in a RABS is 3.2 times higher than a fixed small cell when the traffic distribution is highly heterogeneous. Finally, the efficiency and performance of the proposed algorithms are also detailed.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2023.3269906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107795","6G;small cells;UAVs;wireless communications;network optimization;robotic manipulators","Grasping;Wireless communication;Robots;Telecommunication traffic;Propulsion;Energy efficiency;Base stations","","3","","43","IEEE","25 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Research has gained momentum over the past few years to study the gains of RIS and the optimal configuration of its elements. This paper is concerned with the optimal configuration of RIS elements; we consider a single base station (BS) serving multiple single-antenna users and formulate the problem of minimizing the total transmit power while jointly optimizing the allocated power to users and the RIS phase shifts. In line with the existing literature, the problem is decomposed into power control and RIS phase shift sub-problems. The power control sub-problem is the conventional power problem which is solved optimally through closed-form expression. Then, we tackle the problem of RIS passive beamforming optimization and propose two solutions leveraging a linear transformation and element-wise Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT), respectively. The main idea of the linear transformation approach is to reduce the number of optimization variables to the number of users associated with the RIS from the number of its elements which is, in general, very large. On the other hand, the main idea of the element-wise KKT-based approach is to obtain a closed-form expression for the RIS phase shifts for a multi-user scenario, similar to the single-user case. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes have performance in total transmitted power close to the numerical solution and have much lower computational complexity than the baseline solutions. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed solutions have a competitive performance in terms of optimality and complexity for large-scale RIS. Hence, our approach represents a general framework for configuring RIS elements in real scenarios.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3233469","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Fonds Québécois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies; Concordia University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040911","6G;linear transformation;RIS;SDR","Optimization;Complexity theory;Array signal processing;6G mobile communication;Wireless networks;Closed-form solutions;Resource management","","13","","39","IEEE","8 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most contemporary ML classifiers are quite susceptible to adversarial inputs. Attackers can easily perturb the methodology through noise addition in the model itself. To mitigate this, the current work presents a defensive mechanism for attenuating the adversarial attacks against projected ML-based models for mmWave beam anticipation by incorporating adversarial training. Furthermore, as training 6G mmWave beam prediction model necessitates the use of large and comprehensive datasets that could include sensitive information regarding the user's location, differential privacy (DP) has been introduced as a technique to preserve the confidentiality of the information by purposefully adding a low sensitivity controlled noise in the datasets. It ensures that even if the information about a user location could be retrieved, the attacker would have no means to determine whether the information is significant or meaningless. With ray-tracing simulations for various outdoor and indoor scenarios, we illustrate the advantage of our proposed novel framework in terms of beam prediction accuracy and effective achievable rate while ensuring the security and privacy in communications.","2768-0029","979-8-3503-4287-1","10.1109/CSNet59123.2023.10339703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10339703","mmWave;massive MIMO;Beamforming;Adversarial ML;Differential Privacy","6G mobile communication;Training;Privacy;Differential privacy;Array signal processing;Ray tracing;Predictive models","","","","18","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Regardless of the distributions of data and services, High-Performance Computing (HPC) enhances speed and provides diversified applications and functionality. The Confluence-Aided Process Organization Method (CAPOM) is suggested in this article to take advantage of process allocations while using an HPC paradigm. The process allocations and completions are scheduled based on prior and current system conditions to minimize waiting time based on the 6G qualities. This implies that state requirements for process allocation, distribution, and completion are carried out with the assistance of federated learning. The initial state allocations are based on the user/application request; in other allocations, the application’s request for completion time and capacity for processing are considered. Offloading and shared processing are, therefore combined to maximize resource deliveries. The federated learning states are checked post-completion times to mitigate the waiting duration of dense service demands. Indicators such as distribution ratios, latency, wait time, and processing rate are considered for the effectiveness of the proofs. The suggested CAPOM achieves an 8.67% higher processing rate, 9.09% reduced latency, 8.76% less wait time, and a 6.73% higher distribution ratio for the various capacities.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3310808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10235956","6G;federated learning;HPC;process allocation;service distribution","Resource management;6G mobile communication;Quality of service;Task analysis;Performance evaluation;Internet of Things;Organizations;Federated learning;Process design;Service computing","","1","","40","CCBYNCND","31 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

New radio and optical wireless access technologies for 3D coverage, new waveforms, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), edge–cloud supported by AI, joint communication and sensing, optical fiber networks, nonterrestrial network (NTN) integration, new network architectures, trusted computing platforms, quantum communications, and digital twin provisioning systems are some of many technology enablers for 6G. However, 6G will support many more vertical industries. This requires defining a new model for network infrastructures that builds on 5G architectures and designs, especially private networks and open networking. This means that operating minor networks independently at their local domains and allowing separated domains to handle services without centralized management may become more mainstream. AI and ML will become important enablers for future network management and control. This segregation within the mobile network architecture allows AI-driven components to maximally utilize resources at their local domain. In addition, minor domains would be able to decompose service requests to reduce operational cost incurred by the network. This network modeling takes advantage of fully automated elements and services that could be onboarded upon user demand for more efficient networks that fully utilize resources in a cost-efficient manner. Therefore, operators and vendors need to work closely with network planning engineers and academia to bring such designs into reality.","1556-6080","","10.1109/MVT.2023.3238481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10058080","","Special issues and sections;6G mobile communication;Cellular networks;Artificial intelligence;Extrapolation;MIMO communication;Visible light communication;Network slicing","","","","0","IEEE","2 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
