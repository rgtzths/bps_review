"Explainable Artificial Intelligence for 6G: Improving Trust between Human and Machine","W.

Evolved 5G and 6G will need sophisticated AI to automate information delivery simultaneously for mass autonomy, human machine interfacing, and targeted healthcare. Trust will become increasingly critical for 6G as it manages a wide range of mission-critical services. As we migrate from traditional mathematical model-dependent optimization to data-dependent deep learning, the insight and trust we have in our optimization modules decrease. This loss of model explainability means we are vulnerable to malicious data, poor neural network design, and the loss of trust from stakeholders and the general public -- all with a range of legal implications. In this review, we outline the core methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in a wireless network setting, including public and legal motivations, definitions of explainability, performance vs. explainability trade-offs, and XAI algorithms. Our review is grounded in case studies for both wireless PHY and MAC layer optimization and provide the community with an important research area to embark upon.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.001.2000050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9141213","","Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Wireless communication;Optimization;Analytical models;Deep learning;6G mobile communication","","145","","15","IEEE","15 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Recently, the structure of 6G networks has tended to be extremely heterogeneous, densely deployed, and dynamic. Combined with tight quality of service (QoS), such complex architecture will result in the untenability of legacy network operation routines. In response, artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning (ML), is emerging as a fundamental solution to realize fully intelligent network orchestration and management. By learning from uncertain and dynamic environments, AI-/ML-enabled channel estimation and spectrum management will open up opportunities for bringing the excellent performance of ultrabroadband techniques, such as terahertz communications, into full play. Additionally, challenges brought by ultramassive access with respect to energy and security can be mitigated by applying AI-/ML-based approaches. Moreover, intelligent mobility management and resource allocation will guarantee the ultrareliability and low latency of services.

In this paper, we introduce an interdisciplinary approach linking the concepts of e-healthcare, priority, big data analytics (BDA) and radio resource optimization in a multi-tier 5G network. We employ three machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, naïve Bayesian (NB) classifier, logistic regression (LR), and decision tree (DT), working as an ensemble system to analyze historical medical records of stroke out-patients (OPs) and readings from body-attached internet-of-things (IoT) sensors to predict the likelihood of an imminent stroke. We convert the stroke likelihood into a risk factor functioning as a priority in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Hence, the task is to optimally allocate physical resource blocks (PRBs) to HetNet users while prioritizing OPs by granting them high gain PRBs according to the severity of their medical state. Thus, empowering the OPs to send their critical data to their healthcare provider with minimized delay. To that end, two optimization approaches are proposed, a weighted sum rate maximization (WSRMax) approach and a proportional fairness (PF) approach. The proposed approaches increased the OPs' average signal to interference plus noise (SINR) by 57% and 95%, respectively. The WSRMax approach increased the system's total SINR to a level higher than that of the PF approach, nevertheless, the PF approach yielded higher SINRs for the OPs, better fairness and a lower margin of error.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992555","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); INTERNET(grant numbers:EP/H040536/1); STAR Projects(grant numbers:EP/K016873/1); TOWS Projects(grant numbers:EP/S016570/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086596","HetNet uplink optimization;MILP;machine learning;patient-centric;network optimization;naïve Bayesian classifier;decision tree;logistic regression;ensemble;6G;resource allocation;spectrum allocation;big data analytics","Optimization;Machine learning;Big Data;Stroke (medical condition);Resource management;Support vector machines;Interference","","42","","65","CCBY","5 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, this paper proposes, (a) four architectures for aerial infrastructure sharing, (b) a novel element, i.e., Aerial Asset Manager (AAM) for deployment and sharing of LAPs by operators from one of the above four architectures.

The analytical model and simulations results reveal the forecasting accuracy of 96% for data traffic.

Moreover, 6G will provide superior coverage by integrating space/air/underwater networks with terrestrial networks, given that traditional wireless communications are not able to provide high-speed data rates for nonterrestrial networks. Visible light communication (VLC) is a high-speed communication technique with an unlicensed frequency range of 400-800 THz and can be adopted as an alternative approach to solving these problems. In this article, we present the prospects and challenges of VLC in 6G in conjunction with its advances in high-speed transmissions. Recent hot research interests, including new materials and devices, advanced modulation, underwater VLC (UVLC), and signal processing based on machine learning, are also discussed. It is envisaged that VLC will become an indispensable part of 6G given its high-speed transmission advantages and will cooperate with other communication methods to benefit our daily lives.","1556-6080","","10.1109/MVT.2020.3017153","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0403603); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61925104); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9208801","","Light emitting diodes;Bandwidth;Real-time systems;High-speed optical techniques;Modulation;Optical receivers;Wireless communication","","407","","15","IEEE","29 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
