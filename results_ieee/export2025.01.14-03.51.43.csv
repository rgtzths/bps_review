From both the environmental and economical perspectives, non-homogeneous QoS demands obstruct the minimization of the energy footprints and operational costs of the envisioned robust networks. As such, network intelligentization is expected to play an essential role in the realization of such sophisticated aims. The fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and mobile networks will allow for the dynamic and automatic configuration of network functionalities. Machine learning (ML), one of the backbones of AI, will be instrumental in forecasting changes in network loads and resource utilization, estimating channel conditions, optimizing network slicing, and enhancing security and encryption. However, it is well known that ML tasks themselves incur massive computational burdens and energy costs. To overcome such obstacles, we propose a novel layer-based HetNet architecture which optimally distributes tasks associated with different ML approaches across network layers and entities; such a HetNet boasts multiple access schemes as well as device-to-device (D2D) communications to enhance energy efficiency via collaborative learning and communications.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.104.2100422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9839644","","Servers;Computer architecture;NOMA;6G mobile communication;Heterogeneous networks;Training data;Device-to-device communication;Energy efficiency;Machine learning","","28","","15","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Alongside the advancement of technologies, autonomous vehicles have now come into a greater existence. Due to the resource constraints for obtaining a high processing rate in performing the intelligent tasks, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has been introduced. However, a delay occurs in transferring the information due to the traits of automotive tasks. In this paper, a Federated Learning empowered computation Offloading and Resource management (FLOR) is proposed, which offloads and manages the resources with low latency. The FLOR framework operates over heterogeneous networks that include Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), 5G millimeter-wave (5G-mmWave), and 6G Vehicle-to-Vehicle (6G-V2V) communication. FLOR employs the stochastic network calculus mechanism for computing the upper bound delay of the heterogeneous communication and obtains the probability of offloading mechanism. Upon the detected probability value, the FLOR offloads the computation task to the optimal network. Further, to avoid the increase in resource cost and utilize the available resources efficiently, an effective Radio Resource Management (e-RRM) based on Federated Q-Learning is proposed in FLOR, for allocating and using the available resources optimally. The simulation result shows that the proposed FLOR framework effectively offloads the computation between the available heterogeneous networks with optimal resource allocation by 20.69% than the existing solutions.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2021.3103124","NGNLab Dept of Computer Technology Anna University Chennai; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9511234","Computation Offloading;Vehicular Edge Computing;6G-V2X;Dedicated Short Range Communication;5G millimeter-Wave;Federated Q-Learning;Radio Resource Management","Vehicle-to-everything;Task analysis;Resource management;Edge computing;Delays;6G mobile communication;Servers","","85","","35","IEEE","10 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve such goals, satellite networks are an instrumental technology that grants network coverage even in remote areas without ground infrastructure and provides an offloading option when ground networks are too crowded with workload. However, for an efficient implementation, it is important to take into account not only the particular characteristics surrounding space satellite systems but also the challenges involving the joint resource allocation of ground and satellite networks. To aid in this, we propose the use of network slicing for selecting and reserving specific resources for each new incoming user request. These resources are chosen through a machine-learning-based technique that learns the patterns of user requests and which paths are more often requested. These networks paths are given higher costs so that they are only allocated when there is no other option. Simulations show that this strategy results in higher efficiency in resource allocation, which allows the system to serve a higher number of users.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.001.2100287","Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), Japan(grant numbers:JPJ000254); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9749189","","6G mobile communication;Satellites;Costs;Machine learning algorithms;Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Reinforcement learning","","31","","15","IEEE","4 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, edge resources from small base stations are insufficient to match the wide variety of services of the future vehicular networks. Besides, due to the high-speed nature of the vehicles, users have to switch the connections among different base stations, whereas such way will cause external latency during the data request. Therefore, it is vital to enable the local cache of vehicle users to realize the reliable autonomous driving. In this paper, we consider caching the contents in the local cache, small base station, and edge server. In practice, the request preference of some single users may be different from a whole region. To maximize the efficiency of content cache, we design a strategy that uses reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize cache schemes on different devices.

At mmWaves/sub-THz frequencies, MIMO channels exhibit few leading paths in the space-time (ST) domain (i.e., directions or arrival/departure and delays). Algebraic low-rank (LR) channel estimation exploits ST channel sparsity through the computation of position-dependent MIMO channel eigenmodes leveraging recurrent training vehicle passages in the coverage cell. LR requires vehicles’ geographical positions and tens to hundreds of training vehicles’ passages for each position, leading to significant complexity and control signaling overhead. Here, we design a deep-learning (DL)-based LR channel estimation method to infer MIMO channel eigenmodes in V2X urban settings, starting from a single least squares (LS) channel estimate and without needing vehicle’s position information. Numerical results show that the proposed method attains comparable mean squared error (mse) performance as the position-based LR.

However, its uncertainty, referred to as dynamic and randomness, from the mobile device, wireless channel, and edge network sides, results in high-dimensional, nonconvex, nonlinear, and NP-hard optimization problems. Thanks to the evolved reinforcement learning (RL), upon iteratively interacting with the dynamic and random environment, its trained agent can intelligently obtain the optimal policy in MEC. Furthermore, its evolved versions, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), can achieve higher convergence speed efficiency and learning accuracy based on the parametric approximation for the large-scale state-action space. This paper provides a comprehensive research review on RL-enabled MEC and offers insight for development in this area. More importantly, associated with free mobility, dynamic channels, and distributed services, the MEC challenges that can be solved by different kinds of RL algorithms are identified, followed by how they can be solved by RL solutions in diverse mobile applications.

In this letter, we investigate the power allocation problem in LEO satellite networks with RSMA mechanism based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. Specifically, in order to achieve better RSMA performance, the LEO satellite base station (SBS) has to effectively allocate transmit power to common and private streams, which is very challenging due to the uncertain and limited information of the channel distribution. To solve this problem, a highly-effective proximal policy optimization (PPO) based scheme is further proposed, which enables the LEO SBS to learn an optimal power allocation strategy to maximize the sum rate of the system without knowing any prior information.

However, faced with a large tenant base and personalized slicing requirements, network slice providers should put significant effort to complete the lifecycle management of the slices, which severely hinders the implementation of the large-scale end-to-end sliced network. Intent-driven network (IDN) can be used to reduce the complexity of management and maintenance for 6G Radio Access Networks (RANs) by automating the configuration and operation of managed networks with a high-level abstraction of intent. Therefore, we present the framework of Intent-driven Slice Management and Maintenance for 6G RANs, which is termed as IDSM.

Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) could provide safe and vital life-saving reinforcement when evacuating populations from a large-scale disaster site. However, navigation in disaster-affected environments is vulnerable to the presence of unpredictable moving obstacles. Existing solutions perform optimal route determination while considering the presence of a single rescue vehicle. To optimize path planning and enhance energy efficiency in the presence of a fleet of rescue vehicles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), multiple sources and target destinations, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Dijkstra (MADRD) algorithm in a sixth generation (6G) assisted environment to achieve cooperative navigation in the Route Planning Framework. The MADRD algorithm allows vehicles to learn from the experiences and behavior of other CAVs to obtain an optimal path from the source to the affected target site. Route selection and throttle parameters are optimized to achieve efficient fuel consumption, reduced travel time and lower traffic congestion. We simulate the Route Planning Framework on a large-scale real-world road network. The experimental results indicate that MADRD achieves 40% less fuel consumption, 45% higher road throughput and 34% less evacuation time than its state-of-the-art counterparts.","2473-2400","","10.1109/TGCN.2022.3163764","NGNLab, Department of Computer Technology, Anna University, Chennai, India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745588","Connected autonomous vehicles;UAV;6G;deep reinforcement learning;multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient;emergency evacuation;route planning","Planning;Fuels;Roads;Navigation;Adaptation models;Traffic congestion;Reinforcement learning","","9","","25","IEEE","31 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, satisfying the demands of network slice requests is a challenging task. Energy-efficient, secure, and Quality of Service (QoS) aware network slicing is important since network slices must share fewer amounts of resources. Further, implementing secure network slicing for software-defined networks (SDNs)/network function virtualization (NFV) is crucial. In this article, we tackle the issues, such as security, QoS, and resource consumption issues through network slicing and load balancing mechanisms in SDN/NFV assisted 6G environments. First, deep network slicing is implemented using generative adversarial network (GAN) for network slicing and management. Based on the slice capacity, slice priority, and QoS demands of network slices, GAN predicts the appropriate slice and links for data transmission. For each slice, the directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based blockchain technology is used in which traditional consensus is replaced by the Proof of Space (PoS) algorithm. A limitation of scalability and high resource consumption in the traditional blockchain is addressed in DAG-blockchain. To improve security, context-based authentication, and secure handover schemes are presented using the Markov decision making (MDM) and weighted product model, respectively. Then, higher load faced at the SDN controllers and switches are addressed by intruder packets classification and packets migration through hybrid neural decision tree (HyDNT) and Hybrid Political optimizer with a Heap-based Optimizer (HPoHO), respectively. To predict the load accurately, environment learning is implemented using the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Finally, the performance of the proposed SliceBlock model is evaluated.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3161838","Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2019YFG0399); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743334","Blockchain;Proof of Space (PoS);software-defined network (SDN)/network function virtualization (NFV);soft actor-critic (SAC) and supervised learning approaches","5G mobile communication;Security;Handover;Network slicing;6G mobile communication;Authentication;Blockchains","","32","","43","IEEE","25 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The scheme exploits the advantages of deep-Q-network (DQN) and minimizes the search state explosion through a reward-penalty framework. A dynamic allocation of unallocated resource blocks (RBs) to mobile units (MUs) is carried out and once the allocation of RBs is complete, we integrate blockchain (BC) to record the transactional ledgers. The resource usage of MUs is recorded through smart contracts (SCs). We model the proposed scheme as a convex optimization problem, and subproblems are decomposed into a Pareto-optimal solution via Techebyecheff decomposition. In the simulation, we compare our scheme against FSA, and fifth-generation (5G) based DSA schemes like reinforcement learning (RL), deep neural networks (DNN)-based, and duelling DQN based schemes. The comparative analysis of 6G-DQN is modeled in terms of reward formulation, scalability of 6G-DQN-assisted DSA, and profit scenarios of BC-based allocation through intelligent channel control. The scheme proposes significant findings, with the best fit learning rate of 0.0001, and takes 500 episodes to converge to 60 total resource blocks. The servicing latency of the scheme is 272.4 ms, compared to 2010 ms in the duelling DQN approach. In spectrum allocation, an improvement of 26.32% is observed against non-DQN approaches, and 13.57% in the fairness parameter for spectrum allocation due to BC inclusion. The findings present the scheme efficacy for DSA over the aforementioned conventional approaches.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3186725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9810019","6G;blockchain;deep-Q learning;spectrum allocation","Resource management;6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Artificial intelligence;Dynamic scheduling;Computational modeling;Visible light communication","","16","","38","IEEE","28 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, it has been shown that ML algorithms exhibit superior capabilities in handling complicated network tasks, such as channel equalization, estimation and modeling, resources allocation, and opportunistic spectrum access control, to name a few. Nevertheless, concerns pertaining to privacy and communication overhead when sharing raw data of the involved clients with a server constitute major bottlenecks in the implementation of centralized ML techniques. This has led to the emergence of a new distributed ML paradigm, namely federated learning (FL), which can reduce the cost associated with transferring raw data, and preserve privacy by training ML models locally and collaboratively at the clients' side. Hence, it becomes evident that integrating FL into VLC networks can provide ubiquitous and reliable implementation of VLC systems. With this motivation, this is the first in-depth review in the literature on the application of FL in VLC networks. To that end, besides the different architectures and related characteristics of FL, we provide a thorough overview on the main design aspects of FL-based VLC systems. Finally, we also highlight some potential future research directions of FL that are envisioned to substantially enhance the performance and robustness of VLC systems.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.005.00334","Khalifa University(grant numbers:KU/FSU-8474000122,KU/RC1-C2PS-T2/8474000137,KU/RC1-C2PS-T5/8474000137); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9749224","","Visible light communication;Data privacy;Wireless networks;Robustness;Reflection;Collaborative work;Resource management;6G mobile communication","","27","","15","IEEE","4 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The agents need to learn using a sufficient number of training steps before they converge to the optimal performance. After convergence, they can take reliable management actions. However, the scalability of QL could be severely hindered, particularly in the convergence time - when the number of QL agents increases. To overcome the scalability issue of QL, in this paper, we explore the potentials of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, a function approximation-based method.

Traditionally, most service provisioning techniques considered security metrics separately from the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Expectation (QoE) parameters. The QoS/QoE parameters include data throughput, experienced delay, tolerable latency, jitter, resource utilization rate, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, fairness, and other emerging key performance indicators (KPIs). Also, there are various security attributes, such as encryption key strength, authentication strength, network anomaly score, privacy metric, and so on. Typically, the resource allocation optimization techniques to maximize the security aspects to protect the communication of mobile users or user equipment (UEs) have an adverse effect on the service quality. Therefore, a key research gap exists in balancing service quality and security levels in communication networks that has been either overlooked or identified in a rather scattered manner by researchers in the recent decade. Thus, a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art to clearly address this research gap and outline the possible solutions is yet to appear in the existing literature. In this paper, we address this by surveying the existing practices, challenges, and opportunities in the emerging 6G (i.e., beyond 5G) networks, where various AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based techniques such as deep learning meet the classical optimization techniques, to balance the service performance and security levels. Several networking topologies with relevant use-cases are included in the survey to discuss the existing and emerging trends of isolated as well as joint treatment of service and security levels.

Currently, there are many isolated cyber testbeds; however, little research has focused on methods to automatically build a federated cyber testbed in general and especially in 6G testbeds. In this paper, we show how to use the FCTaaS services can be used to seamlessly compose a federated cyber testbed that allows researchers to experiment with and evaluate different algorithms to implement different algorithms to conduct data analytics, cybersecurity, and resilient algorithms. In particular, we will show how the FCTaaS can be used to develop highly efficient and accurate federated learning algorithms that can tolerate a wide range of attacks against ML algorithms such as data poisoning and ML model attacks.","2161-5330","979-8-3503-1008-5","10.1109/AICCSA56895.2022.10017506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10017506","5I6G;resource federation;testbed;security;Blockchain;federated cyber testbed;federated learning","6G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Smart buildings;Federated learning;Smart cities;Reliability engineering;Data models","","6","","54","IEEE","20 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The operators slice physical resources from the edge, all the way to datacenter, and are responsible to micromanage the allocation of these resources among tenants bound by predefined Service Level Agreements (SLAs). A key task, for which recent works have advocated the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), is tracking the tenant demand and scaling its resources. Nevertheless, for edge resources (e.g. RAN), a question arises whether operators can: (a) scale edge resources fast enough (often in the order of ms) and (b) afford to transmit huge amounts of data towards a cloud where such a DNN-based algorithm might operate. We propose a Distributed-DNN architecture for a class of such problems: a small subset of the DNN layers at the edge attempt to act as fast, standalone resource allocator; this is coupled with a Bayesian mechanism to intelligently offload a subset of (harder) decisions to additional DNN layers running at a remote cloud. Using the publicly available Milano dataset, we investigate how such a DDNN should be jointly trained, as well as operated, to efficiently address (a) and (b), resolving up to 60% of allocation decisions locally with little or no penalty on the allocation cost.","","978-1-6654-0876-9","10.1109/WoWMoM54355.2022.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9842858","","Deep learning;Wireless communication;Training;Costs;Uncertainty;Neural networks;Bayes methods","","3","","30","IEEE","9 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transfer Learning (TL) has great potential to empower promising 6G-enabled IoV, such as smart driving assistance, with its outstanding features including enhancing the quality and quantity of training data, speeding up learning processes, and reducing computing demands. Although TL had been widely adopted in wireless applications (e.g., spectrum management and caching), its reliability and security in 6G-enabled IoV were still not well investigated. For instance, malicious vehicles in source domains may transfer and share untrustworthy models (i.e., knowledge) about connection availability to target domains, thus adversely affecting the performance of learning processes. Therefore, it is important to select and also incentivize trustworthy vehicles to participate in TL. In this article, we first introduce the integration of TL and 6G-enabled IoV and provide TL applications for 6G-enabled IoV. We then design a secure and reliable transfer learning framework by using reputation to evaluate the reliability of pre-trained models and utilizing the consortium blockchain to achieve secure and efficient decentralized reputation management. Moreover, a deep learning-based auction scheme for the TL model market is designed to motivate high-reputation vehicles to participate in model sharing.

Due to its interoperable nature, the integration of heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud radio access networks (CRANs), is performed at ease. This integration is managed using software-defined networks (SDNs) for managing the Quality of Service (QoS) experience of the users, irrespective of the application. This manuscript proposes the service virtualization and flow management framework (SVFMF) for the reliable utilization of resources in the 6G-cloud environment. The imbalance in a service request and response due to overloaded and idle virtual resources is addressed in this framework. For this purpose, this framework endorses service virtualization and user allocation modules for mitigating the drawbacks of imbalanced service allocations. Linear decision making of the service virtualization process helps to reduce the computation and service discovery by identifying overloaded services and performing a reallocation. The purpose of user allocation is to distribute the service requests to the idle service providers to reduce the prolonged wait time of the increasing user requests. The performance of the proposed framework is verified using experimental analyses, for the metrics service discovery and computation time, service failure ratio, and flows. The reliability of SVFMF is proved by varying the density of users, virtual machines, service requests, and user allocation per virtual machine, respectively.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3077895","U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:CNS 1650831,CNS/SaTC 2039583,1828811,1924092); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9424691","Deep learning;Internet of Things (IoT);service virtualization;sixth generation (6G);user allocation","Internet of Things;Virtualization;6G mobile communication;Resource management;Quality of service;Cloud computing;Mathematical model","","22","","30","IEEE","6 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve green and sustainable communication, energy harvesting is a feasible technology to prolong the lifetime of IoT. However, the existing energy harvesting architecture cannot guarantee the privacy of energy users while improving the intelligence and effectiveness of energy transmission. To solve these issues, we propose a differential privacy and intelligent reflecting surface empowered privacy-preserving energy harvesting framework for 6G-enabled IoT. First, a secure and intelligent energy harvesting framework is designed, which includes an intelligent reflecting surface-aided radio frequency power transmission mechanism and a differential privacy-based energy harvesting mechanism. Second, an exponential mechanism-based privacy-preserving energy harvesting scheme is established, where we analyze the adversary mode, propose the differential privacy-enabled location-preserving algorithm, and provide security analysis and proof.

On-demand resource allocation in accordance with attack strength is a must for 6G vehicular edge learning. The existing works just focus on realizing low latency for AI resource allocation in vehicular edge learning, which ignores vehicles’ high security-defense demands for computation resources in the face of attacks. To address this, this paper proposes an on-demand incentive mechanism to achieve coordinated optimization of security defense resource allocation over 6G vehicular edge learning. First, we propose budget-feasible incentive contracts for computation resource allocation based on vehicles’ security-defense demands, which maximizes the learning utility of each vehicle type with a particular demand level. The contracts are tailored with the optimal resource allocation and incentive rewards with respect to different demand sensitivities. Next, apart from minimizing the single iteration time with the designed contracts, we design an optimization model of learning parameters for local accuracy to minimize the overall iteration time. Finally, simulation results show the feasibility and efficiency of the security-defense recourse allocation. This work is significant to improve the defense capability of 6G vehicle-edge learning against dynamic threats.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8347-7","10.1109/ICC45855.2022.9838704","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9838704","On-demand;security defense;budget-feasible;incentive design;resource allocation;vehicular edge learning","6G mobile communication;Sensitivity;Simulation;Resource management;Security;Artificial intelligence;Vehicle dynamics","","","","12","IEEE","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The rising and inevitable off-loading requirements of IoE devices have resulted in an unprecedented increase in the reliance on edge and cloud paradigms. However, such a reliance on far-end technologies to access already scarce resources can often result in increased latency and unstable connection issues due to limited bandwidth. In this paper, we investigate the solution for such a stringent network design by presenting a conceptual cloud architecture based on key components such as resource allocation, scheduling and task off-loading for IoE devices. The IoE devices utilise a scheduler to access resources from nearby higher resourced IoE devices for their task computation, where the scheduler allocates incoming requests according to the availability of resources within a cluster of devices or to other devices in nearby clusters. Motivated by these design characteristics, we propose a design of a novel Main Task Off-loading Scheduling Algorithm (MTOSA) for efficient task allocation and dissemination. We present a theoretical analysis of five different scheduling policies namely Round Robin (RR), Strongest Channel (SC), Max Rate (MR), Proportional Fair (PF) and Priority Base (PB) scheduling to find an optimal technique for task off-loading in futuristic networks. Furthermore, we compare the performance of these five scheduling policies with the two existing scheduling policies from the literature. It is shown through various experiments that the proposed MTOSA algorithm performs better when compared with the existing schemes for different performance parameters.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3203711","School of Computing, Mathematics and Engineering at Charles Sturt University Australia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9874791","Edge-based cloud;6G;IoE;smart devices;AI;QoS;task off-loading;machine learning (ML);scheduling;resource allocation","Task analysis;Resource management;6G mobile communication;Scheduling;Cloud computing;Scheduling algorithms;Load modeling;Edge computing","","12","","48","CCBY","1 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
