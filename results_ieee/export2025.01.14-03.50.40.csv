Unfortunately, effective slicing of Radio Access Networks (RAN) is still challenging due to time-varying network situations. This paper proposes a new intelligent RAN slicing strategy with two-layered control granularity, which aims at maximizing both the long-term QoS of services and spectrum efficiency (SE) of slices. The proposed method consists of an upper-level controller to ensure the QoS performance, which enforces loose control by performing adaptive slice configuration according to the long-term dynamics of service traffic. The lower-level controller is to improve SE of slices, by tightly scheduling radio resources to users at the small time-scale. To realize the proposed RAN slicing strategy, we propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is a hierarchical structure that collaboratively integrating the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and double deep-Q-network algorithm. Specifically, the lower-level control problem is a mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem with multiple constraints. This kind of problem is hard to be directly solved by the exiting DRL algorithms, since it involves searching for the solution in a vast set of mixed-integer action space, which will induce unbearable computational complexity. Thus, we propose a novel action space reducing approach, embedding the convex optimization tools into the DDPG algorithm, to speed up the lower-level control. Furthermore, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent RAN slicing scheme.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3090423","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Program(grant numbers:RGPIN2018-06254); Canada Research Chair Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9459763","Network slicing;5G beyond;6G;deep reinforcement learning;and radio resource management","Quality of service;Network slicing;Stochastic processes;Resource management;Optimization;Mathematical model;Dynamic scheduling","","84","","34","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To satisfy stringent requirements of diversified services, network slicing is developed, which enables service-oriented resource allocation by tailoring the infrastructure network into multiple logical networks. However, there are still some challenges in cross-domain multi-dimensional resource management for end-to-end (E2E) slices under the dynamic and uncertain environment. Trading off the revenue and cost of resource allocation while guaranteeing service quality is significant to tenants. Therefore, this article introduces a hierarchical resource management framework, utilizing deep reinforcement learning in admission control of resource requests from different tenants and resource adjustment within admitted slices for each tenant. In particular, we first discuss the challenges in customized resource management of 6G. Second, the motivation and background are presented to explain why artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in resource customization of multi-tenant slicing. Third, E2E resource management is decomposed into two problems, multi-dimensional resource allocation decision based on slice-level feedback, and real-time slice adaption aimed at avoiding service quality degradation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-based customized slicing. Finally, several significant challenges that need to be addressed in practical implementation are investigated.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000644","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1803304); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61822104,61771044,B170003); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:FRF-TP-19-002C1,FRF-TP-19-0S1A1,RC1631); University of Science and Technology Beijing; Communication University of China(grant numbers:SKLMCC2020KF010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9382026","","Resource management;6G mobile communication;Network slicing;Dynamic scheduling;Decision making;Real-time systems","","58","","15","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The article then introduces a novel statistical federated learning (StFL)-based analytic engine for zero-touch 6G massive network slicing, which performs slice-level resource prediction by learning in an offline fashion while respecting some preset long-term service level agreement (SLA) constraints defined in terms of the empirical cumulative distribution function and the percentile statistics, and hence uses a new proxy-Lagrangian two-player strategy to solve the local non-convex federated learning task without settling for surro-gates only. This guarantees 20 × lower service-lev-el agreement (SLA) violation rate with respect to the federated averaging (FedAvg) scheme, while achieving more than 10 × EE gain compared to an SLA-constrained centralized deep learning algorithm, which paves the way to sustainable mas-sive network slicing.

In this context, energy efficiency becomes a critical challenge to be solved for harnessing these promising applications to realize “green” 6G networks. As a remedy, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been proposed for improving energy efficiency by beneficially reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. In conventional RIS solutions, however, the received signal-to-in-terference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) sometimes may become degraded. This is because the signals impinging on an RIS are typically contaminated by interfering signals that are usually dynamic and unknown. To address this issue, “learning” the properties of the surrounding spectral environment is a promising solution, motivating the convergence of artificial intelligence and spectrum sensing, referred to here as spectrum learning (SL). Inspired by this, we develop an SL-aided RIS framework for intelligently exploiting the inherent characteristics of the radio frequency spectrum for green 6G networks. Given the proposed framework, the RIS controller becomes capable of intelligently “thinking and deciding” whether or not to reflect the incident signals. Therefore, the received SINR can be improved by dynamically configuring the binary ON-OFF status of the RIS elements. The energy efficiency benefits attained are validated with the aid of a specific case study. Finally, we conclude with a list of promising future research directions.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.110.2100301","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101492); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2021FZZX001-21); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9687460","","6G mobile communication;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Green products;Learning (artificial intelligence);Interference;Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces","","19","","15","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

One of the major research focuses of 6G is to enable massive Internet of Things (mIoT) applications. Like Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax), forthcoming wireless communication networks are likely to meet massively deployed devices and extremely new smart applications such as smart cities for mIoT. However, channel scarcity is still present due to a massive number of connected devices accessing the common spectrum resources. With this expectation, next-generation Wi-Fi 6 and beyond for mIoT are anticipated to have inherent machine intelligence capabilities to access the optimum channel resources for their performance optimization. Unfortunately, current wireless communication network standards do not support the ensuing needs of machine learning (ML)-aware frameworks in terms of resource allocation optimization. Keeping such an issue in mind, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based, one of the ML techniques, a framework for a wireless channel access mechanism for IEEE 802.11 standards (i.e., Wi-Fi) in mIoT. The proposed mechanism suggests exploiting a practically measured channel collision probability as a collected dataset from the wireless environment to select optimal resource allocation in mIoT for upcoming 6G wireless communications.","2471-2833","","10.1109/MCOMSTD.001.2000055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9464923","","6G mobile communication;Wireless sensor networks;5G mobile communication;Wireless networks;IEEE 802.11ax Standard;Throughput;Resource management","","18","","15","IEEE","25 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Conventionally, IoT/edge devices need to transmit data directly to the base station for training the model using machine learning techniques. The data transmission introduces privacy issues that might lead to security concerns and monetary losses. Recently, federated learning was proposed to partially solve privacy issues via model sharing with the base station. However, the centralized nature of federated learning only allows the devices within the vicinity of base stations to share trained models. Furthermore, the long-range communication compels the devices to increase transmission power, which raises energy efficiency concerns. In this work, we propose the distributed federated learning (DBFL) framework that overcomes the connectivity and energy efficiency issues for distant devices. The DBFL framework is compatible with mobile edge computing architecture that connects the devices in a distributed manner using clustering protocols. Experimental results show that the framework increases the classification performance by 7.4 percent in comparison to conventional federated learning while reducing the energy consumption.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.012.2100153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9690145","","Training data;Base stations;Privacy;Energy efficiency;6G mobile communication;Collaborative work;Propagation losses;Distributed computing","","26","","15","IEEE","21 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In the context of 6G, more computing resources are required, a problem that is dealt with by Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). However, due to the dynamic change of service demands from various locations, the limitation of available computing resources of MEC, and the increase in the number and complexity of IoE services, intelligent resource provisioning for multiple applications is vital. To address this challenging issue, we propose in this paper IScaler, a novel intelligent and proactive IoE resource scaling and service placement solution. IScaler is tailored for MEC and benefits from the new advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Multiple requirements are considered in the design of IScaler's Markov Decision Process. These requirements include the prediction of the resource usage of scaled applications, the prediction of available resources by hosting servers, performing combined horizontal and vertical scaling, as well as making service placement decisions. The use of DRL to solve this problem raises several challenges that prevent the realization of IScaler's full potential, including exploration errors and long learning time. These challenges are tackled by proposing an architecture that embeds an Intelligent Scaling and Placement module (ISP). ISP utilizes IScaler and an optimizer based on heuristics as a bootstrapper and backup. Finally, we use the Google Cluster Usage Trace dataset to perform real-life simulations and illustrate the effectiveness of IScaler's multi-application autonomous resource provisioning.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3066625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9380677","Resource provisioning;deep reinforcement learning (DRL);service placement;resource scaling;5G;6G;AI;Internet of Everything (IoE)","6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Clustering algorithms;Servers;Dynamic scheduling;Artificial intelligence;Internet of Things","","71","","42","IEEE","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

That means, unless new degrees of freedom and intelligent dynamic adaptability is added, any significant gain in SE must come at the cost of EE. Even the most predominant approaches for capacity enhancement such as network densification yield gains in SE at the cost of increased energy consumption. Moreover, in future mobile networks, the key challenge is not only the rampantly growing volume of traffic, but also the spatiotemporal variability of the traffic. These observations call for a paradigm shift in the way cellular networks are designed and operated. Therefore, in this work, we propose a new cellular architecture called SpiderNet: Spectrally Efficient and Energy Efficient Data Aided Demand Driven Elastic Architecture for 6G Wireless Networks. The key idea behind SpiderNet is to introduce additional degrees of freedom to relax the tight coupling between the SE and EE and database-aided intelligence to enable dynamic adaptive operation for simultaneous enhancement of both SE and EE. This goal is achieved by shifting the pivot of operation from the rigid always ON BS centric cells to user centric (UC) on demand cells. The SpiderNet architecture consists of a layer of low-density large footprint and database aided control BS underlayed by high-density switchable data BS.

However, the stringent service requirements of CAV applications on reliability, latency, and high speed communications will present big challenges to 6G networks. New channel access algorithms and intelligent control schemes for connected vehicles are needed for 6G-supported CAV. In this article, we investigated 6G-supported cooperative driving, which is an advanced driving mode through information sharing and driving coordination. First, we quantify the delay upper bounds of 6G vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications with hybrid communication and channel access technologies. A deep learning neural network is developed and trained for the fast computation of the delay bounds in real-time operations. Then, an intelligent strategy is designed to control the intervehicle distance for cooperative autonomous driving. Furthermore, we propose a Markov chain-based algorithm to predict the parameters of the system states, and also a safe distance mapping method to enable smooth vehicular speed changes.

With the advent of 6 G technology, e.g., millimeter wave and terahertz, fast and massive data transfers become possible between moving objects. In this paper, we consider a scenario where vehicles act as mobile edge caching nodes and form a local cloud, to provide popular contents for nearby users via 6 G communication. To maximize the efficiency of content allocation under the limitation of short communication range, we first predict the driving trajectories of vehicles with a Markov chain model and estimate the popularity level of contents in each urban area. Next, we design a scoring system based on the above predictions to compare users' satisfaction and computational efficiency of different algorithms. Finally, we find a subset of vehicles with appropriate content to serve the demand in the area.

As pointed out, the redefinition largely leverages Microtechnologies and Nanotechnologies (MEMS/NEMS), and some state of the art examples of current classes of micro/nanodevices that could be relevant in making the 6G real are also reported and discussed.","","978-1-6654-4511-5","10.1109/SmartIoT52359.2021.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9556162","Internet of Things (IoT);Super-IoT;Tactile Internet (TI);5G;6G;WEAF Mnecosystem;Artificial Intelligence (AI);MEMS;NEMS;Microelectronics;Nanoelectronics","6G mobile communication;Tactile Internet;Earth;Water;Ecosystems;Nanomaterials;Spinning","","4","","69","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, an extraordinary amount of energy will be consumed by network infrastructure, while functions of massively deployed Internet of Everything (IoE) devices are limited by embedded batteries. Therefore, energy self-sustainable (ESS) 6G is proposed in this article. First of all, it may achieve network-wide energy efficiency by exploiting cell-free and airborne access networks as well as by implementing intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). Second, by exploiting radio-frequency/visible-light signals for on-demand wireless information and energy provision (WIEP) and for enabling passive backscatter communication, “zero-energy” IoE devices may become a reality. Furthermore, IoE devices actively adapt their transceivers for better performance to a dynamic environment. Case studies of cell-free and IRS based WIEP are provided for demonstrating the advantage of our proposed architecture in terms of energy self-sustainability. This article aims to provide a first glance at primary designing principles of ESS-6G.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.001.2000156","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2019J001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9261955","","6G mobile communication;Energy efficiency;Throughput;Wireless communication;Radio frequency;Uplink;MIMO communication;Visible light communication","","58","","15","IEEE","17 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

These trends inspire a novel technical design principle that seamlessly integrates two originally decoupled functionalities, i.e., wireless communication and sensing, into one system in a symbiotic way, which is dubbed symbiotic sensing and communications (SSaC), to endow the wireless network with the capability to “see” and “talk” to the physical world simultaneously. Noting that the term SSaC is used instead of ISAC (integrated sensing and communications) because the word “symbiotic/symbiosis” is more inclusive and can better accommodate different integration levels and evolution stages of sensing and communications. Aligned with this understanding, this article makes the first attempts to clarify the concept of SSaC, illustrate its vision, envision the three-stage evolution roadmap, namely neutralism, commensalism, and mutualism of SaC. Then, three categories of applications of SSaC are introduced, followed by detailed description of typical use cases in each category.

Extensive efforts have been made to provide on-demand traffic scheduling in IoT networks through machine learning algorithms. However, the current learning approaches are hindered by the heterogeneous information in ubiquitous IoT systems since the data are collected from different domains (e.g., space, air, ground, and ocean). To uncover the complete picture of ubiquitous IoT, this article presents a novel federated imitation learning framework for traffic prediction without compromising privacy. This framework contains a knowledge-sharing module to imitate the status of cross-domain models. After that, we design a distributed resource allocation algorithm, where the IoT devices cooperatively make association decisions using matching theory. Simulation results reveal that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art federated transfer learning and achieves desirable traffic scheduling performance in a cross-domain environment.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2100134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606808","","6G mobile communication;Privacy;Ubiquitous computing;Scheduling algorithms;Simulation;Transfer learning;Prediction algorithms;Internet of Things;Resource management;Collaborative work","","7","","15","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
