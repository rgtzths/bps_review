Caching popular contents on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which are closer to the ground end users, can efficiently improve the QoS and decrease the communication pressure of satellites.

To acquire the channel quality information, pilot (or reference) signals are commonly transmitted, measured, and reported to the network. However, the process of channel quality acquisition is both time and energy consuming. Moreover, the radio resources are competitively shared by the pilot signals and users' data. This motivates an employment of prediction-based approaches determining the channel quality at low cost to avoid over-consumption of resources for pilots. Machine learning is seen as an efficient way to deal with the channel quality prediction, since it allows to reveal usually hidden relations among known and unknown channel quality measurements. In this article, we first overview state-of-the-art works leveraging the time, frequency, and spatial correlations among already known channel qualities and the channel(s), whose quality should be predicted. Furthermore, we outline a framework for a network correlation-based channel prediction enabling to determine the quality of unknown channel between any two communicating nodes by knowing only channels of these two nodes to reference nodes. Then, we demonstrate use-cases and application scenarios for all machine learning-based channel quality predictions. We also assess potential reduction in channel quality measurement-related overhead by all approaches to demonstrate their complementarity and capabilities to support low-overhead and energy-friendly massive deployment of devices in 6G mobile networks.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.001.2200305","ANR(grant numbers:ANR-19-P3IA-0002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10192311","","6G mobile communication;Time-frequency analysis;Costs;Employment;Energy measurement;Machine learning;Radio communication;Radio spectrum management;Channel capacity;Quality assessment","","4","","15","IEEE","24 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, RL-based solutions are still not widely adopted in commercial cellular networks. One of the primary reasons for this is the slow convergence of RL agents when they are deployed in a live network and when the network’s context changes significantly. Concurrently, the open radio access network (O-RAN) paradigm promises to give mobile network operators (MNOs) more control over their networks, furthering the need for intelligent and RL-based network management. O-RAN’s standardized interfaces will allow MNOs to make real-time custom changes to intelligently control various RRM functionalities. We consider a RAN slicing scenario in which MNOs can modify the weights of the RL reward function. This enables MNOs to change the priorities of fulfilling the service level agreements of the slices. However, this results in a practical challenge since the RL agent needs to adapt promptly to the changes made by the MNO. This challenge is addressed in this paper, where we first present and discuss the results from an exhaustive experiment to examine the efficiency of using transfer learning (TL) to accelerate the convergence of RL-based RAN slicing in the considered scenario. We then propose a novel predictive approach to enhance the TL-based acceleration by selecting the best-saved policy for reuse. By adopting the proposed policy transfer approach, RL agents are able to converge up to 14000 learning steps faster than their non-accelerated counterparts. The proposed machine learning (ML)-based predictive approach also shows up to a 96.5% accuracy in selecting the best expert policy to reuse for acceleration.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2023.3258692","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:RGPIN-2019-05667,RGPIN-2021-04050); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10075524","O-RAN;RAN slicing;resource allocation;predictive transfer learning;accelerated reinforcement learning;6G","Resource management;Next generation networking;Convergence;Radio access networks;Wireless networks;Accelerated aging;Knowledge engineering","","8","","37","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Allocating resources in 6G is a pressing issue that needs additional study. Virtual network embedding focuses primarily on node mapping and link mapping, the two most important network properties. Resource allocation in a 6G network is addressed here by using the Slice-Aware Network Embedding (SANE) technique. The slice-defined node ranking method is shown for node mapping, and the k-shortest route algorithm is presented for link mapping, both of which are contributed to by this work.

It inaugurates the era of massive network slicing as a distributive technology where tenancy would be extended to the final consumer through pervading the digitalization of vertical immersive use-cases. Despite the promising performance of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in network slicing, lack of transparency, interpretability, and opaque model concerns impedes users from trusting the DRL agent decisions or predictions. This problem becomes even more pronounced when there is a need to provision highly reliable and secure services. Leveraging eXplainable AI (XAI) in conjunction with an explanation-guided approach, we propose an eXplainable reinforcement learning (XRL) scheme to surmount the opaqueness of black-box DRL. The core concept behind the proposed method is the intrinsic interpretability of the reward hypothesis aiming to encourage DRL agents to learn the best actions for specific network slice states while coping with conflict-prone and complex relations of stateaction pairs. To validate the proposed framework, we target a resource allocation optimization problem where multi-agent XRL strives to allocate optimal available radio resources to meet the SLA requirements of slices.

Moreover, most existing approaches require the instantaneous channel gain between subnetworks, which are usually difficult to be collected. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose a novel effective intelligent radio resource management method using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL), which only needs the sum of received power, named received signal strength indicator (RSSI), on each channel instead of channel gains. However, to directly separate individual interference from RSSI is an almost impossible thing. To this end, we further propose a novel MARL architecture, named GA-Net, which integrates a hard attention layer to model the importance distribution of inter-subnetwork relationships based on RSSI and excludes the impact of unrelated subnetworks, and employs a graph attention network with a multi-head attention layer to exact the features and calculate their weights that will impact individual throughput.

The two techniques can support each other to increase the performance of the 6G system. In a RIS-aided system, channel estimation is a challenging problem, especially when applying passive RIS which has no signal processing. This paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-based channel estimation method using a convolutional long-short term memory (CNN-LSTM) model for RIS-NOMA wireless communication systems that integrate RIS and NOMA techniques. CNN-LSTM leverages both the benefits of convolutional neural network (CNN) as well as long-short term memory (LSTM), in which CNN can capture special features while LSTM can capture temporal features of time-series data. The simulation results indicate that the proposed CNN-LSTM model shows its robustness toward the variation of the RIS-NOMA system parameters, i.e., transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), power allocation factor, and the number of RIS elements. The impacts of the RIS-NOMA system parameters on the prediction accuracy of the proposed DL-based channel estimation methods are evaluated via different performance metrics. The results reveal that the performance accuracy in terms of normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), coefficient of determination R-squared score (R2 score), mean absolute scaled error (MASE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) increases with an increased transmit SNR, power allocation factor of the first user and the number of RIS elements. Additionally, the CNN-LSTM prediction performance shows its superiority as compared to those of the four benchmark models including the CNN1D-LSTM model using one-dimensional convolution layer (conv1D), CNN1D-BiLSTM model using bidirectional long-short term memory, CNN model and LSTM model.","2831-316X","","10.1109/TMLCN.2023.3278232","Vice-Chancellor Research Scholarship, Ulster University, U.K; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10129974","Channel estimation;CNN-LSTM;LSTM;NOMA;6G network;reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)","Channel estimation;NOMA;6G mobile communication;Convolutional neural networks;Wireless communication;Predictive models;Estimation","","24","","70","CCBY","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such scenarios, DL technology can be employed to extract parameter information from acquired data samples, thereby improving algorithm convergence speed and performance. This tutorial aims to explore the utilization of artificial neural networks (ANNs), including deep neural networks (DNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to parameterize models or algorithms, with gradient-based methods utilized for optimizing the ANNs. These data-driven techniques, which derive model or algorithm features from massive amounts of data rather than relying on pre-established rules, are collectively known as data-driven methods. The tutorial primarily focuses on the research and application of DL in the physical layer of wireless communication systems. Firstly, DL can enhance model-based algorithms for signal detection or channel estimation, improving computational efficiency and system performance. Secondly, as traditional model-based methods increasingly struggle to meet the growing demands of next-generation communication systems operating in complex interference and uncertain channel conditions, DL presents promising opportunities to redesign baseband modules, including coding/decoding and detection, among others.","2163-0771","979-8-3503-8261-7","10.1109/APCC60132.2023.10460749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10460749","","Wireless communication;Deep learning;Computational modeling;System performance;Tutorials;Physical layer;Sensors","","","","0","IEEE","14 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this solution has technical shortcomings, for example, it does not support aperiodic service scheduling, and does not define a coordination mechanism between applications and networks.

However, the heterogeneous nature of these services' requirements, along with the limited RAN resources, makes RAN slicing very complex. Indeed, the challenge that mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) face is to rapidly adapt their RAN slicing strategies to the frequent changes of the environment constraints and service requirements. Machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), are increasingly considered a key enabler for automating the management and orchestration of RAN slicing operations. Nerveless, the ability to generalize DRL models to multiple RAN slicing environments may be limited due to their strong dependence on the environment data on which they are trained. Federated learning enables MVNOs to leverage more diverse training inputs for DRL without the high cost of collecting this data from different RANs. In this article, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning approach for Open RAN Slicing. In this approach, MVNOs collaborate to improve the performance of their DRL-based RAN slicing models. Each MVNO trains a DRL model and sends it for aggregation. The aggregated model is then sent back to each MVNO for immediate use and further training.

Among O-RAN, the newly introduced radio intelligence controller (RIC), including near-real-time RIC and non-real-time RIC, provides intelligent control of the radio network. However, existing research on RIC only focuses on the implementation of interfaces and progress, while ignoring the resource allocation between near-RT RIC and non-RT RIC which is essential for ultra-low latency in 6G networks. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based resource allocation scheme that minimizes service latency by optimizing requests allocated and processed between near-RT RIC and non-RT RIC. Specifically, we aim at improving the request acceptance and minimum the average service latency, in our policy, we apply the Double DQN to decide whether the requests are processed at near-RT RIC or non-RT RIC and then allocate the near-RT RIC resource to finish the requests. Firstly, we define and formulate the resource allocation problem in RIC by the Markov decision process framework. Then we propose an allocation scheme based on the Double Deep Q network technique (Double DQN), with two variations (Double DQN with cache and Double DQN without cache) for handling different request types. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in offering the maximum reward. Additionally, we conduct experiments to analyze the updating of cached AI models and the results show that the performance of the proposed method is always optimal compared to other algorithms in terms of latency and accepted number of requests.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3311888","2020 National Key Research and Development Program “Broadband Communication and New Network” Special “6G Network Architecture and Key Technologies”(grant numbers:2020YFB1806700); National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2022YFB2902100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10239168","Radio intelligence controller;AI native;O-RAN;double DQN;6G","Artificial intelligence;6G mobile communication;Resource management;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Computer architecture;3GPP;Radio access networks","","5","","31","CCBYNCND","4 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The overall aim of the paper is to devise a resource allocation strategy by learning in a centralized, distributed, or hybrid manner. Experimental results show that, in small environments with low and high mobility, the centralized MADRL is four times better compared to the hybrid MADRL, while the hybrid MADRL is four times better compared to the distributed MADRL in the average quality of experience (QoE). However, in large environments with high mobility, distributed MADRL is three times better compared to the centralized MADRL and five times better compared to the hybrid MADRL in the average QoE. These findings demonstrate that the optimal MADRL approach in resource allocation depends on the resource allocation scheme, environment size, and mobility level.

To address these problems, technologies such as device-to-device (D2D) communication and machine learning (ML) are introduced to the traditional cellular communication network to improve network performance. However, due to the interference caused by spectrum reusing, efficient resource allocation for both cellular users and D2D users is necessary.

In this paper, our aim is to make the network more scalable and more flexible in terms of conflicting performance indicators such as achievable data rate, overhead, and complexity indicators. To this end, we introduce a new metric, i.e, throughput-overhead-complexity (TOC), for the proposed machine learning-based algorithm, which supports a trade-off between these performance indicators. In particular, the decision making based on TOC is solved via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) which determines an appropriate resource allocation policy. Furthermore, for the selected algorithm, we employ the soft actor-critic (SAC) method which is more accurate, scalable, and robust than other learning methods.

In the 5G network, network slicing techniques that enable the isolated management of multiple virtual networks are devised for ensuring quality-of-service (QoS). However, existing network slicing frameworks are inherently insufficient to provide guaranteed performance to those new network services. Even with ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), low-level performance pertaining to the delivery of radio frames or packets rather than service-level performance has only been dealt with, although there exists a large gap between them. The discrepancy comes from the fact that none of those services runs based on the packets. They run based on their own application data units (ADUs) whose size is dynamic and mostly much larger than just a packet. In this regard, in order to directly guarantee the service-level performance, we propose a new slice management and orchestration framework that can make the time duration to complete the transmission (i.e., completion time) of variable ADUs over fluctuating wireless channels constant through two techniques leveraging the knowledge of ADUs: a time budget orchestration and a radio resource management for ADU completion.

Since satellite networks are time-varying and have limited resources, efficient resource management schemes are needed to accommodate massive and ubiquitous service requests. As a remedy, virtual network embedding (VNE) can enable diverse virtual network requests (VNRs) to share the same substrate network resources to improve resource utilization. However, existing works are few and mainly rely on heuristic methods, whose static embedding strategies cannot be optimized according to the resource state. In this article, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) aided load-balanced VNE algorithm (DRL-LBVNE) for the regional satellite networks, where we first build a low-cost regional satellite network scenario and derive its multi-fold coverage constraints. Besides, we design a novel preprocessing scheme to reduce mapping failure, where the satellite network is divided into multiple mapping regions, and VNRs are only deployed in the mapping region with the lowest load. In the node mapping stage, the DRL agent can calculate the embedding probabilities of each physical node based on the environment state. Moreover, a comprehensive metric for path selection is presented in the link mapping stage.

However, the research on 6G is still in its infancy, and only the first steps have been taken to conceptualize its design, investigate its implementation, and plan for use cases. Toward this end, academia and industry communities have gradually shifted from theoretical studies of AI distribution to real-world deployment and standardization. Still, designing an end-to-end framework that systematizes the AI distribution by allowing easier access to the service using a third-party application assisted by zero touch service provisioning has not been well explored. In this context, we introduce a novel platform architecture to deploy a zero touch PAI as a service (PAlaaS) in 6G networks supported by a blockchain-based smart system. This platform aims to standardize the PAI at all levels of the architecture and unify the interfaces in order to facilitate service deployment across application and infrastructure domains, relieve users' worries about cost, security, and resource allocation, and at the same time respect the 6G's stringent performance requirements. As a proof of concept, we present a federated-learning-as-a-service use case where we evaluate the ability of our proposed system to self-optimize and self-adapt to the dynamics of 6G networks in addition to minimizing the users' perceived costs.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.001.2200508","Qatar National Research Fund(grant numbers:NPRP13S-0205-200265); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10047856","","6G mobile communication;Knowledge engineering;Costs;Prototypes;Standardization;Security;Resource management;Artificial intelligence","","14","","13","IEEE","16 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In many scenarios, the learning task is performed in the Cloud, while experience samples are generated directly by edge nodes or users. Therefore, the learning task involves some data exchange which, in turn, subtracts a certain amount of transmission resources from the system. This creates a friction between the need to speed up convergence towards an effective strategy, which requires the allocation of resources to transmit learning samples, and the need to maximize the amount of resources used for data plane communication, maximizing users' Quality of Service (QoS), which requires the learning process to be efficient, i.e., minimize its overhead. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off and propose a dynamic balancing strategy between the learning and data planes, which allows the centralized learning agent to quickly converge to an efficient resource allocation strategy, while minimizing the impact on QoS.

However, traditional UAV monitoring systems rely on direct communication between the UAV and the ground pilot, which has several limitations such as limited range, poor reliability, and susceptibility to interference. To overcome these limitations, there has been significant interest in integrating UAVs into cellular networks such as 5G/6G network slicing. The flexibility of network slicing allows UAVs to operate on different slices based on their communication needs, which can improve their performance and efficiency. However, integrating UAVs into network slicing also poses several challenges, such as managing communication and permissions of UAVs and base stations, access control of UAVs, and identity management of UAVs. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain, Non-Fungible Token(NFT), Federated Learning(FL), and Zero-Trust(ZT) security-enabled UAV monitoring platform for 5G/6G network sliced environments. We propose a novel approach in which UAVs are represented as NFT tokens within the platform. This innovative representation allows for enhanced security and trust in the system, aligning with the principles of the Zero-Trust security model, which assumes no implicit trust in any network component or user. Furthermore, we propose a FL system that operates on top of the blockchain, which can analyze data from multiple UAVs across different network slices. Our proposed FL system uses coordinator-less models, which eliminates the attacks of a centralized coordinator. As a use case, we consider a scenario where our proposed system detects anomaly communications of UAVs and identifies attack surfaces via analyzing network traffic data of UAVs using FL.

Nevertheless, among these indicators, sustainability is one of the primary goals. We must continue to ensure good network performance regarding Quality of Service (QoS), security, flexibility, and intelligence while reducing the environmental impact. This problem mainly occurs in Massive Machine Type Communications (MTC), where the number of devices increases exponentially, and most of these devices are battery-constrained and challenging to be charged. Several 6G technologies are candidates, such as Green Communications, to address these challenges. It aims to reduce energy consumption and serve the network to a vast number of servers cost-effectively. Green communication integrates energy saving in wireless links, hardware devices, and Infrastructure. In other words, to ensure sustainability requirements, we need to rethink the design of every component of the 6G network: energy consumption in Wireless Links, energy consumption in Infrastructure, and energy consumption in Tx/Rx Hardware. Embedded Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an effective solution. It allows constrained hardware to run complex AI algorithms, avoiding energy-costly transmission processes. However, Embedded AI devices still need to offload some computation tasks, such as training, and current MTC communication protocols struggle to meet the requirements. Thus, we propose a new communication design based on embedded AI and computational offloading in Massive MTC communication.

The integration of AI with 6G can help support green energy and sustainable system by overcoming the complexity of network flaws. The Internet of Things (IoT) utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the management of large amounts of data, reduce energy consumption, regulate traffic, and facilitate data storage. The primary difficulty in IoT is creating intelligent agents that can enhance smart packet transmission scheduling for Ultra Reliability Low Latency Connection (URLLC). The best channel to employ for smart packet transmission scheduling in the IoT must have a low estimate Packet Error Rate (PER), as well as minimal packet delays from channel errors, and retransmissions. To improve smart packet transmission scheduling by shortening the interval between the estimated and target action value, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network and Deep Q Network (GAN-DQN). To avoid significant critical fluctuations in the target action value, GAN-DQN training is based on reward correction to evaluate the value of each action for accurate states. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GAN-DQN increase IoT system reliability by reducing the packet loss caused by various multiuser arrival at a BS while cutting Transmission Delay (TD) to improve intelligent transmission scheduling and power consumption.","","979-8-3503-3286-5","10.1109/CCWC57344.2023.10099362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099362","AI;IoT;URLLC;packet error rate;6G;deep-RL","6G mobile communication;Training;Channel estimation;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Generative adversarial networks;Scheduling;Delays","","1","","37","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) mechanisms have been developed to enable deterministic features in standard Ethernet. 5G and 6G networks are looking forward to integrate TSN and benefit from its ability to ensure determinism. Accommodating the complexity of TSN networks in 6G is not straightforward. In particular, conventional rule-based heuristic algorithms are not optimized for such environments. Therefore, the TSN network management framework should be equipped with the right tools allowing to compute at runtime new TSN configuration for each event (e.g. change in topology, new application, new device, etc.). To address this problem, recent standardization initiatives (IETF and ITU-T) have investigated the opportunities to use Network Digital Twin (NDT) paradigm for these use cases of 6G networks.This paper proposes a framework that puts together the key enablers to support NDT deployment for TSN-based public or private 6G network and to cope with the relevant challenges. In particular, we define a modular and self-learner NDT framework. To construct the DT model, the framework can rely on open source simulators/emulators with predefined models, or in other cases, it may learn the DT model from real infrastructure using Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) techniques trained over collected data.

However, as UAV-BSs have limited energy or battery storage, solutions to optimize energy efficiency while providing high-quality services are necessary.

First, Co-UAV-BSs are deployed with DQN algorithm to to get the UAV-BSs’ optimal flight paths, which mainly adopted to detect out of service users in such areas. Then the users are completely clustered based on the detection results. After that, Co-UAV-BSs and Ca-UAV-BSs are deployed hierarchically based on the user distribution and sought to optimize the energy efficiency with acceptable user services. Still, DQN algorithm and the A3C algorithm are used for obtaining all the UAV-BSs’ location deployment and users’ best connections.
